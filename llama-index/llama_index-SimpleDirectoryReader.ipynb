To address \\nthis gap, we perform a systematic review and two quantitative analyses. First, we analyze results \\nfrom 39 studies, obtained through the PRISMA method. Less than 50% of the studies that show up as \\nresults for the term “bilingual disadvantage” report exclusively a disadvantage, that shows bilinguals \\nperforming worse than monolinguals in a task. A Bayesian analysis reveals robust evidence for \\nbilingual effects, but no evidence for differences in the proportion of advantages and disadvantages, \\nsuggesting that when results from different cognitive domains such as executive functions and \\nverbal fluency are analyzed together, bilingual effects amount to a zero-sum game. This finding was \\nreplicated by repeating the analysis, using the datasets of two recent meta-analyses. We propose that \\nthe equilibrium we observe between positive and negative outcomes may not be accidental. Contrary \\nto widespread belief, advantageous and disadvantageous effects are not stand-alone outcomes in free \\nvariation. We reframe them as the connatural components of a dynamic trade-off, whereby enhanced \\nperformance in one cognitive measure is offset by an incurred cost in another domain.\\nOne of the most heatedly debated topics in psycholinguistics concerns the effects of bilingualism on cognition. \\nMany studies have linked bilingualism to an enhanced performance in tasks that tap into a range of executive \\nfunction  measures1–3. Although knowing multiple languages facilitates communication as well as exposure to a \\nvariety of cultures and is thus always an  advantage4, the term “bilingual advantage” has a narrower meaning. It \\nwas introduced to refer specifically to results that show that bilinguals may perform better than monolinguals in \\ncertain cognitive tasks, mostly pertaining to conflict  resolution2,3,5. In parallel to the line of literature that pro -\\nduced results showing that bilinguals demonstrate a superior performance in certain tasks, another line started \\nadducing results that revealed a bilingual disadvantage, mainly in the domain of semantic fluency and  naming6,7.\\nAs the original finding of a bilingual advantage in executive functioning was put to test in an ever-expanding \\nrange of child and adult, neurotypical and neuroatypical populations, conflicting results started emerging, even \\nwhen using the exact same tasks. Some studies found a robust bilingual advantage in executive  functioning3, while \\nothers failed to find evidence for its existence, obtaining results that suggested that the effect is indistinguishable \\nfrom  zero8,9. This inconsistent occurrence of the bilingual advantage gave rise to concerns about its status as a \\nrobust  phenomenon10,11. While several explanations have been offered for both sets of  results12–16, the degree to \\nwhich bilingual advantages and disadvantages co-occur is still unknown. This is an important knowledge gap, \\ngiven that the field of bilingualism research has been repeatedly linked to meta-analyses that reveal publication \\nbias against negative  results17,18. Some studies have even claimed that the entire idea of a bilingual advantage \\nmay have stemmed from this publication  bias17. Since some of the effects that attest to publication bias did not \\n replicate19,20, a clearer understanding of the prevalence of bilingual advantages and disadvantages is missing.\\nImportantly, the problem runs deeper than not knowing the degree of co-occurrence of advantages and dis-\\nadvantages in bilingual cognition, because most studies describe either  advantages or  disadvantages, as if they \\nwere stand-alone effects. What is consistently left in the margins is the appreciation of the fact that enhancing \\none aspect of a system (e.g., any goal-directed system, including cognition) entails a cost for another aspect of \\nthe same  system21. Succinctly put, enhanced computational performance never comes for  free21.

This means that if a(n) (dis)advantageous effect is found, it likely forms part \\nof a trade-off, because enhanced performance in one domain is bound to be compensated in another domain. In \\nbiology, the notion of the trade-off refers to a negative correlation between processes that make use of the same \\nfinite resources within an  organism22. From an evolutionary point of view, such trade-offs are frequent across \\nspecies and emerge because one trait cannot be optimized without creating an expense for other traits, given \\nthat organisms function together as integrated wholes  in the Darwinian  sense23. From a developmental point of \\nview, trade-offs often translate into a negative relationship between traits, based on morphological, physiological, \\nand environmental characteristics that contribute to the development of an organism (e.g., a speed vs. stamina \\ntrade-off in Olympic sprinters vs.  marathoners24).\\nAlthough a few studies have mentioned the possibility that specific advantages and disadvantages share \\norigin (e.g., Luo et\\xa0al.25 ask whether it is possible that a common mechanism underlies the opposite effects that \\nthey found for letter and category fluency in bilinguals), only a handful of them have approached the effects of \\nbilingualism on cognition through explicitly proposing a trade-off that links them together. Struys et\\xa0al.26 present \\nevidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off in executive functioning, with the effect being specific to the bilingual \\npopulations they tested. More specifically, they report null results in terms of a bilingual advantage and clear-cut \\nresults for speed-accuracy trade-offs in bilinguals, but not in monolinguals: bilinguals either boost their response \\ntimes sacrificing accuracy or they prioritize accuracy, slowing down their  performance26,27. Marsh et\\xa0al.28 observe \\nthat decreased semantic fluency in bilinguals can be explained as an offset against enhanced executive functions \\nor metalinguistic awareness. Last, Leivada et\\xa0al.29 find evidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off in the grammatical \\ndomain. Testing the fallibility of monolinguals and bilinguals in grammatical illusions (i.e., sentences that appear \\nmeaningful and well-formed, but are not), bilinguals were found to be better than monolinguals in detecting \\nthe grammatical anomalies in the seemingly well-formed sentences, but they were also slower in providing an \\nanswer. Leivada et\\xa0al.29 frame this finding through proposing the Plurilingual Adaptive Trade-off Hypothesis, \\naccording to which, the bilinguals’ adaptive alteration of their language control  abilities30 may result in enhanced \\n(pragmatic) monitoring, but this advantage is part of a larger bundle of effects that are not all advantageous.\\nThe trade-off approach carries important implications for the findings of many (meta-)analyses, and espe-\\ncially for the ones that report both a null finding and a negative finding (i.e., bilingual disadvantage), or group \\ntogether the two, eventually juxtaposing this “negative/null” category to the category of positive findings (i.e., \\nbilingual advantage). For example, de Bruin et\\xa0al.17 examine whether the publication of conference abstracts \\nis affected by the stance they take in the bilingual-advantage debate. They find evidence for a publication bias: \\nstudies that report a disadvantage are the least likely to be published, while studies supporting the bilingual-\\nadvantage hypothesis are the most likely to be published. The classification system they employ consists of 4 \\nmutually exclusive categories: (i) positive result (i.e., evidence in favor of a bilingual advantage), (ii) mixed result, \\npredominantly positive (i.e., evidence in favor of a bilingual advantage, albeit not in all tasks or populations), \\n(iii) mixed result, predominantly negative (i.e., partial/inconsistent evidence in favor of a bilingual advantage, \\nbut failure to find it in conditions where it was expected), and (iv) negative or null result (i.e., evidence in favor \\nof a bilingual disadvantage or absence of significant differences between monolinguals and bilinguals). The last \\ncategory groups together two very different outcomes: an effect that has been argued to exist and an effect that \\nhas been argued to be indistinguishable from zero. However, under the perspective we have laid out so far, find -\\ning a bilingual disadvantage is potentially interpreted as indirect evidence for a bilingual advantage in another \\ndomain. Consequently, treating a negative result as synonymous to a null result, and putting them together in \\none category, does not do justice to the correlation between advantages and  disadvantages20.\\nTo give a second example of how bringing trade-offs into the picture is informative in relation to interpret -\\ning the conclusions of meta-analyses, Lehtonen et\\xa0al.18 argue that their analysis of 152 studies does not provide \\nsystematic support for the view that bilingualism grants an advantage in cognitive control functions in adults. \\nMoreover, they report finding evidence for a small bilingual disadvantage in verbal fluency tasks. Y et if advan-\\ntages and disadvantages are viewed as two sides of the same coin, finding a disadvantage probably entails the \\npresence of an advantage (unless of course one explains why bilingualism would behave in a way that challenges \\ncurrent knowledge about the workings of human  cognition21, by virtue of causing enhancements that are not \\ncompensated for). If enhanced computational performance indeed does not come for free, observing a cost in \\nthe form of a disadvantage inevitably raises the question of what enhancement this disadvantage is compensat -\\ning for. From this perspective, Lehtonen et\\xa0al.18 provide direct evidence for a bilingual disadvantage and indirect \\nevidence for a bilingual advantage. This reframing of their results seems to be at odds with their conclusion that \\nbilingualism is not reliably  associated with cognitive benefits.\\nAlthough it remains an open question whether such advantages should be attributed to monitoring two \\nlanguage systems, and by extension to bilingualism per se, as opposed to the interaction of bilingualism with \\nother factors (e.g., socio-economic status, cultural  background9,31,32, our focus is not on the much-discussed, yet \\nstill unclear, origin of the observed effects  (see33 for a discussion of open questions in that domain), but on their \\nsignificantly understudied distribution. In a nutshell, the purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which \\nadvantageous and disadvantageous effects complement each other across different child and adult, neurotypical \\nand neuroatypical populations. Subsequently, we discuss the nature of the cognitive trade-offs, specifically as they \\nemerge in the context of bilingualism research and present their main characteristics in terms of development \\n(i.e., how they come to exist in the individual) and plasticity (i.e., how they evolve over time in the individual).', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

There-\\nfore, meta-analyses, review articles, and theoretical articles were excluded. Second, studies had to be written \\nin English. Third, studies had to be published after 1950. Fourth, data from at least one monolingual and one \\nbilingual group had to be reported. Last, screened abstracts that outlined finding only advantages, without any \\nacknowledgment of behavioral testing for possible disadvantages or some reference to specific factors that may \\nweaken the expected advantage, were excluded (e.g., ethnographic studies that talked about a bilingual advan-\\ntage in the context of individual interviews were excluded).

To bring them together, \\nwe performed an extensive literature review (without using the PRISMA protocol as each search was tailored to \\none study in the original pool of data), and we identified those studies that come closest to the original study in \\nterms of as many of the following characteristics as possible: the languages used (spoken or signed), the tested age \\ngroups, and the overall linguistic profile. However, as in all meta-analyses, the obtained comparisons are at best \\napproximate. We cannot provide a perfect or close-to-perfect match across all variables, because such a degree of \\nmatching is not possible for many of the tested populations. This point relates to the visibility of certain groups \\nin bilingualism research: the level of approximation is solid when one compares studies which target popula-\\ntions that have been thoroughly tested (e.g., bilingual college students of English and Spanish in the US), but \\nless solid when one has very few studies from which a close match can be drawn, because the target populations \\nuse severely understudied minority, non-standard, or non-official languages. In terms of our methods, faced \\nwith the choice of favoring either solid matching (by including only those studies that deal with populations that \\nhave a high visibility and can afford the firmest comparisons) or inclusion (by including those studies that can \\nonly partially be matched for a subset of their characteristics), we chose the latter. However, we highlight again \\nthe caveat of comparability: there is no perfect match between the groups and all comparisons operate on some \\nlevel of approximation that is heavily influenced by the overall visibility and representation of certain groups.\\nTurning to the quantitative analysis of the present study, this differs from previous meta-analyses on the topic \\nin many critical respects. First, it does not focus exclusively on effects found in the domain of executive functions. \\nIf one examines the recent meta-analyses of bilingual adaptations, it is likely that one will obtain an incomplete \\npicture, because these analyses involve samples that represent only the domain of executive  control12,18,19,35,36. \\nHowever, bilingualism may have an impact on a variety of cognitive measures (e.g., syntactic processing, meta-\\nlinguistic awareness, word learning). There is no reason for confining our analyses to results that come from \\none cognitive domain, when there is ample evidence for bilingual adaptations across domains. To remedy this \\nbias in the representation of bilingual adaptations and provide a more complete picture, no cognitive domain \\nwas excluded from our pool of data. Second, the process of outlier removal in meta-analyses may contribute to \\nmasking group differences between monolinguals and  bilinguals19, leading to a null effect. To bypass this chal -\\nlenge, the present study will use an alternative quantitative approach, following  Grundy19. Last, unlike previ-\\nous meta-analyses and quantitative analyses on the topic, this analysis does not take bilingual advantages and \\ndisadvantages as unique outcomes within a study. In other words, if a study finds evidence for both advantages \\nand disadvantages, both results are represented in our analysis.\\nOur quantitative analysis has two aims. The first aim is to determine whether studies in our pool of data are \\nmore likely to favor a null outcome or find evidence for bilingual effects. To measure this, we adapt the quantita -\\ntive approach of  Grundy19 in terms of coding, while using the same statistical analyses: Studies were coded as 1 \\nif they found evidence for a bilingual advantage or disadvantage, and as -1 if no group differences were reported. \\nIf a study found both types of effects (e.g., a bilingual advantage in reaction times and a bilingual disadvantage \\nin accuracy), this was coded as two entries, one for each effect.\\nThe second aim is to zoom into the studies that find evidence for bilingual effects in order to determine \\nthe overall proportion of bilingual advantages and disadvantages.

If a study \\nfound evidence for both effects, two entries were created for this study, following the previously described process.\\nCritics of the bilingual-advantage hypothesis have proposed that a Bayesian approach is more appropriate \\nwhen one seeks to examine the effects of bilingualism on executive  functions37. Although the present quantitative \\nanalysis does not focus exclusively on executive functions, we concur about the importance of running analyses \\nthat are informative about how likely the data are to occur under the null vs. the alternative hypothesis. For this \\nreason, Bayesian analyses are reported. The analyses were run using jamovi, version 2.238. Table\\xa0 1 represents the \\ninput, which corresponds to the studies obtained through the PRISMA protocol (Fig.\\xa0 1). Assessing for possible \\nsample biases, 5 studies from the pool of data were excluded from the quantitative analysis because they involved \\nvery small sample sizes (< 30), which have been argued to provide a blurry picture in bilingualism  research39, \\ncarrying the risk of a substantial increase of the rate of Type I  errors10.\\nResults\\nPRISMA-obtained pool of data: overall effects\\nThe first analysis concerns the overall effects: Do studies in our pool of data provide evidence for bilingual adapta-\\ntions? 34 studies were included in this analysis (Table\\xa0 1). A Bayesian one-sample t-test suggests that the answer is \\npositive,  BF10 = 44.998. Details about the interpretation of the Bayes factor (BF) are given in the Supplementary \\nInformation. As Fig.\\xa0 2 shows, the evidence in favor of interpreting the data as more likely under the alternative \\nhypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that studies in our pool of data are more likely to find evidence for bilingual \\neffects than null effects) is very strong. In the panel “Effect” , we see the overall pattern across studies reporting \\na bilingual effect (1) or not (−\\xa01). The circle represents the mean across studies and the error bars represent \\nstandard error. In the panel “Prior and Posterior” , the prior shows the starting probability before introducing the \\ndata, and the posterior represents the “updated” probability, after the data has been factored in. The panel “Bayes \\nFactor Robustness Check” shows how the BF would change if different priors had been chosen. In our case, the \\nBF is stable across various prior specifications, indicating the robustness of our findings. The sequential analysis \\nrepresents the progression of the BF as each new study enters the analysis. This panel shows that the obtained \\nevidence is very strongly in favor of the alternative hypothesis, which supports the existence of bilingual effects \\n(taking positive and negative outcomes together) as opposed to null outcomes.\\nPRISMA-obtained pool of data: type of effects\\nThe first step of our quantitative analysis has provided evidence for bilingual adaptations. The second step is to \\ndetermine whether one type of effects, advantages or disadvantages, is more frequently attested, by looking into \\nthe overall proportion of bilingual advantages and disadvantages. The literature suggests that publication biases \\naffect the publication of negative  results17,18. The prediction, based on the assumption that the category of bilin-\\ngual advantages is far more plentiful than that of bilingual disadvantages, is that this analysis will reveal that the \\ndata are more probable under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., that one effect is more frequently attested than the \\nother). Repeating the previous analysis while focusing only on the studies in Table\\xa0 1 that find bilingual effects \\n(n = 26), a Bayesian one-sample t-test suggests that there is no evidence that one hypothesis is more strongly \\nsupported than the other,  BF10 = 0.692. BFs between 0.33 and 3 are considered as anecdotal or inconclusive, not \\noffering robust evidence for either  hypothesis40. Since the data are equally likely under either the null or the \\nalternative hypothesis, we cannot conclusively say that either advantages or disadvantages are more prevalent \\nin our pool of data. Figure\\xa0 3 shows the distribution of the results, marking the evidence for the null hypothesis \\nas anecdotal.\\nNotice that in this analysis we have only included studies that find evidence for bilingual effects, excluding \\nthose that find a null result. The reason is conceptual: If a study fails to find evidence for bilingual adaptations, it \\ncannot be determined whether this happens because no real-world effects existed in the first place or because the \\nemployed tasks, testing conditions, or analyses were not sensitive enough to pick up on the effects. Consequently, \\nit is possible that studies with a null outcome affect our sample, by virtue of being included in the analyses as \\npotential hosts of bilingual adaptations, when their status as such cannot be conclusively determined. However, \\nto provide the full picture, we reran the previous analysis including the studies that find a null outcome (n  = 8). \\nWe follow  Grundy19 in coding null outcomes with 0, advantages with 1, and disadvantages with −\\xa01. Again, the \\nresults of a Bayesian one-sample t-test provide only anecdotal evidence for the null  (BF10 = 0.602).\\nAs  Grundy19 notes, one of the main concerns about vote-counting analyses like the one we employed is that \\nthe data may not be weighted fairly if sample size is not considered. The issue of sample and effect sizes is par -\\nticularly relevant in the literature that discusses bilingual  adaptations10,37. To alleviate such concerns, we followed \\nthe weighting procedure of  Grundy19: A sample size correction was applied to the data (the n = 39 studies origi-\\nnally obtained through the PRISMA method) before re-running the analyses. Each study was assigned a weight \\nby dividing the study’s sample size by the total sample size of all studies in our pool of data. This proportional \\nweight was then multiplied by the effect score (i.e., −\\xa01 for a bilingual disadvantage, 1 for a bilingual advantage) \\nto yield a weighted score. Using this approach, a Bayesian one-sample t-test showed moderate evidence in favor \\nof interpreting the data as more probable under the null hypothesis (i.e., equal overall proportion of bilingual \\nadvantages and disadvantages),  BF10 = 0.222. Figure\\xa0 4 shows the distribution of the weighted performance.\\nL&D pool of data: analyses replication\\nOne caveat of our quantitative analysis is that we cannot discard the possibility that our search terms, which \\nfocused on bilingual disadvantages, may have biased our main findings. Succinctly put, it is possible that our \\nfinding that bilingual advantages and disadvantages are equally prevalent in our pool of data is an artifact of our ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Consequently, this result could possibly not be sustained if we analyzed a different pool of data, \\nwhich uses different search terms and inclusion criteria. To address this caveat, we replicate the main finding by \\nrerunning the previous analyses using a second pool of data. This second pool of data contains the datasets of \\ntwo recent meta-analyses: Lehtonen et\\xa0al.18 and Donnelly et\\xa0al.36. The former used the search terms “bilingual” \\nand “monolingual” and terms referring to various domains of cognitive control and executive functioning. The \\nlatter was based on searches that involved a combination of “bilingual” or “bilingualism” with “executive control” , \\n“executive function” , “inhibition” , or “interference control” . Together the two datasets provide a second pool of \\ndata (henceforth, the L&D pool of data) that consists of 186 studies which were analyzed also in  Grundy19 and \\nare here taken as starting point. For our analyses, 7 studies were removed to avoid double representation, as they \\nwere already included in our original pool of data. 12 studies were removed because the full text was not avail -\\nable. 5 studies were removed because they were not in English. 3 studies were removed as they did not report \\nbilingual/monolingual comparisons. 1 study was removed as it did not report the number of participants. 53 \\nstudies were removed for having very small bilingual samples (6–29 participants; cf.10,39 on the consequences of \\nsmall sample biases). Τhe remaining studies (n = 105) were coded and analyzed following the same procedure \\npresented above for the first pool of data. Table\\xa0 2 represents the input, which corresponds to the studies that \\nform the L&D pool of data.\\nThe first analysis addresses the question of whether the L&D pool of data provides robust evidence for bilin-\\ngual adaptations (advantages/disadvantages vs. null). A Bayesian one-sample t-test suggests that the answer is \\npositive,  BF10 = 2.546e+26. Figure\\xa0 5 shows that the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis is classified as \\nextreme, replicating the result we obtained based on our first pool of data.\\nThe second analysis concerns the occurrence of the advantages and disadvantages in the L&D pool of data. \\nFocusing on the studies of Table\\xa0 2 that find evidence for such effects (n = 93), a Bayesian one-sample t-test \\nsuggests that there is no evidence that the data are more probable under the null hypothesis vs. the alternative, \\n BF10 = 1.218 (Fig.\\xa0 6). This result differs from that of  Grundy19, but the difference is explained by the fact that, \\nunlike Grundy, we included in the L&D pool of data verbal processing tasks, and trimmed studies that involved \\nvery small sample sizes (< 30). Recall that BFs between 0.33 and 3 are considered as anecdotal or inconclusive, \\nnot offering robust evidence for either  hypothesis40.

Contrary to what seems to be the tacit assumption in the \\nrelevant literature, and even explicitly argued in some of the studies we analyzed (cf. the claim  in28 on how the \\nidea that whatever mechanism causes a bilingual disadvantage may also be responsible for a bilingual advantage \\nseems counterintuitive), we argue that bilingual advantages and disadvantages need not be conceived as stand-\\nalone outcomes in free variation. Instead, they could be viewed as correlations that occur simultaneously in \\nresponse to some environmental trigger that causes an adaptive alteration to the system. In this sense, the effects \\nof bilingualism on cognition would not induce advantages or disadvantages per se, but trade-offs that come in \\ndifferent forms (e.g., speed-accuracy, accuracy-flexibility, efficiency-resistance to noise).\\nAssuming the existence of a cognitive trade-off means that enhancements of a function, when observed, \\ncapitalize on resources that are used across cognitive domains, such that some aspects of performance, efficiency, \\nrobustness, or flexibility must eventually be  taxed21. One well-established cognitive trade-off, for instance, is the \\nspeed-accuracy one for which, succinctly put, faster performance taxes responses’  accuracy41. This trade-off  \\nhypothesis can be conceived as consisting of different ramifications that respond to an environmental trigger \\n(in this case, bilingualism) through playing a zero-sum game42: Once we zoom out of individual studies and \\nobserve the overall picture in a given population, positive and negative effects (i.e., bilingual advantages and \\ndisadvantages) will likely be found to complement each other, striking a balance that optimizes the use of the \\norganism’s finite resources. Such trade-offs are inherent to cognition and life in  general21, and there is ample \\nevidence of applications of the trade-off hypothesis in different branches of neurocognition or evolutionary \\n ecology42. Generally, trade-offs boil down to key, high-level properties of goal-directed systems (e.g., general or \\ntask-specific aspects of performance, resilience, efficiency, robustness, and flexibility). However, we still do not \\nknow what kind of trade-offs bilingualism confers and what the picture of bilingual adaptations would look like \\nwhen systematically analyzed in terms of trade-offs. While certain general patterns can be discerned (e.g., the \\ntrade-off between enhanced cognitive control measures such as switching and hampered verbal fluency), the \\nfield lacks concrete answers as to what makes these two domains good candidates to pair together in a trade-off. \\nFigure\\xa06.

Instead, it requires the linking  of the two under a shared origin. Most \\nstudies in our pool of data do not link the two fronts, even when they adduce evidence for both advantages and \\ndisadvantages. Perhaps the most explicit exception is found  in43  and44, who argue in favor of a compensatory \\neffect, according to which a bilingual language-processing disadvantage may be offset by enhanced language-\\nindependent, sensory processes. At the same time, while the presence of both effects might be acknowledged in \\nsome studies, the general purpose of a study may grant a more prominent position to one of the two outcomes. \\nConsequently, although many studies in our pool of data have reported both advantages and disadvantages, the \\noverall tendency is for such results to be presented as stand-alone effects. For example, it has been suggested that \\nthe acquisition of complex grammatical phenomena is delayed in bilingual  children45. In children with Specific \\nLanguage Impairment (SLI), bilingualism has been argued to confer an additional  disadvantage46. Following a \\ntrade-off approach, however, reduced speed in acquisition is expected to be compensated for in another domain. \\nIndeed, our results suggest that this might be the case. Bilingual children may need more time to acquire cer -\\ntain grammatical phenomena, but they also demonstrate better L3 learning  abilities47, an enhanced capacity to \\nignore irrelevant  information48 and, for children with SLI, better narrative  competence49, which may translate \\ninto overall enhanced flexibility on their part.\\nOur results show that bilingualism, as an environmental trigger, may confer an array of (dis)advantages that \\nmust be compensated in the opposite direction, such that it could be meaningful to talk about cascade effects, that \\nconsist of multiple (dis)advantages, and not about a single “advantage-disadvantage” pair with fixed components. \\nMoreover, bilingualism is not the only activity with an impact on cognition, but one of the many, like exercis -\\ning navigation  skills50 or doing  music51,52. In the likely event that bilingualism and other sources of adaptation \\nco-exist in an  individual15,53, cognitive enhancements—which imply taxing some cognitive resources—cannot \\ninfinitely add up, because of the finite resources of the system. As a result, a ceiling effect of enhancement may \\nbe reached based on one environmental trigger (e.g., music), effectively rendering other triggers (e.g., bilingual \\nexperience) null, at least for some time. For example,51 compare monolingual and bilingual musicians and non-\\nmusicians and find a musical training advantage on working memory, but not a bilingual advantage. However, \\nthe expectation that it is possible to observe the cumulative effect of two enhancements is perhaps too optimistic. \\nIt is likely that musicians have already reached a cognitive peak thanks to their musical advantage, such that \\nthe effect of bilingualism could not lead to further enhancements, at least not until the first source of influence \\nwanes. Put more succinctly, if an environmental trigger has conferred a cognitive advantage that has already led \\nto superior performance in some domain, a plateau is expected after the peak point, at least until the effect gets \\nweaker as practice, use, and ability of the advantage-conferring experience changes over time.\\nThere is a way in which this point relates to age. Our review of studies that tested child populations suggests \\nthat the observed effects tend to level out with  time45,54. This fluctuation, besides being evidence for develop-\\nmental  plasticity35, can also be construed as the path towards a plateau effect: in early adulthood, performance is \\nalmost at ceiling level, such that environmental factors have less room for enhancing processes associated with \\ncognitive  control26,55. To exemplify, while bilingual toddlers  in54 are invariably associated with a disadvantage in \\nauditory word recognition, a young adult population tested for the same skill is less accurate than monolinguals, \\nyet still faster than them at word learning, suggesting that age contributed to levelling out differences between the \\ntwo groups in some domains. Similarly, the advantage of simultaneous bilingual children over early L2 learners \\nin the acquisition of early-acquired  phenomena45 disappears with time, and the two groups do not differ for \\nphenomena that are typically acquired later in life.\\nOverall, our results suggest that the cascade effects of cognitive adaptations to bilingualism (i) are not dichoto-\\nmous, (ii) possibly form part of trade-offs, whereby enhanced performance in any domain entails certain costs \\nand compensations, and (iii) are dynamic and subject to change under the influence of various environmental \\ntriggers, but also of time and developmental stage. Moreover, our results indicate that there is no domain that \\nstands out in terms of showing either advantages or  disadvantages. As Fig.\\xa0 7 shows, certain domains of testing \\nmay be more strongly associated with either hampered or enhanced performance (e.g., semantic fluency is \\noften associated with a bilingual disadvantage), but such relations are not absolute, such that it is possible that a \\ndomain that is frequently linked to a(n) (dis)advantage also shows results that go in the opposite direction. The \\nconsiderable domain overlap that is shown in Fig.\\xa0 7 illustrates this point.\\nNotwithstanding the outlined variability in our results, a pattern compatible with what has been noted in \\nthe literature can be observed: Bilingual disadvantages are often associated with the verbal domain, whereas \\nenhanced bilingual performance is found in tasks involving executive function  measures56–58. In our pool of \\ndata, the majority of bilingual disadvantages are observed primarily in language production and, to a lesser \\nextent, in speech recognition  abilities44,54. Conversely, the reported bilingual advantages manifest both (i) as \\nreduced switching/interference costs in the non-verbal  domain54,59 and (ii) in the verbal domain, as improved \\nperformance in tone/speech-in-noise  recognition44,60, picture  naming61,62, word  recall63, and letter and phonemic \\n fluency28,64.\\nAdding to advantages manifesting in tasks that test linguistic abilities, opposite bilingual effects also manifest \\nwithin the same  cognitive domain. In our database, this is exemplified  by64  and28. Both studies focus on language \\nproduction and while they report a letter fluency bilingual advantage over monolinguals, such enhancement is \\noffset by a cost in category fluency.

Moreover, if we \\nview such effects as the connatural components of a trade-off, cautionary notes about the inconsistency of the \\nbehavioral data—an inconsistency that is often used to criticize the bilingual-advantage hypothesis  (see66 and \\nreferences therein)—cease being relevant: Results might be inconsistent because they often seek to explain one \\nof the two parts of the trade-off in isolation, as if advantages and disadvantages were stand-alone effects. Y et, they \\nmay not be, and the equilibrium we observed in terms of overall advantages and disadvantages suggests that both \\nsides of the debate have adduced a high volume of results that reliably find evidence for a bilingual effect, either \\npositive or negative. This equilibrium means that there is no overall bilingual cognitive (dis)advantage per se: \\nadvantages in some areas will result in disadvantages in other cognitive domains, due to the dynamic nature of \\nthe induced trade-offs. While it can be claimed that bilingualism always entails an advantage in the sense of being \\nexposed to a different linguistic and possibly cultural  reality4, the measurable cognitive differences subsumed \\nunder the labels “bilingual advantage” and “bilingual disadvantage” are probably temporary, as language (like any \\nother trait) gradually transitions from a heavily controlled, mentally effortful process to a more automated  one67.\\nAiming to capture the bigger picture, it seems that an interesting parallel can be observed between brain and \\nbehavior. Under the trade-off approach outlined in the present work, the cognitive front seems to correlate with \\nthe picture observed at the neuroanatomical level. Similar to how the behavioral data do not point to a single \\ntrade-off, but to many (e.g., accuracy vs. flexibility, speed vs. accuracy), it seems that there is no single, fixed \\nlocus for bilingual adaptations at the level of the brain either. While ample and reliable evidence for brain adapta-\\ntions to bilingualism has been  found30,68,69, there is no single locus for these  adaptations70, and alterations in the \\nconnectivity or volume of various cortical regions and subcortical structures have been  observed71,72.

This offers \\nsupport to recent approaches to bilingualism as a spectrum experience that permits variable modulations based \\non individual language  experiences32,73,74.\\nConclusion\\nResearch in the topic of cognitive adaptations to bilingualism has produced largely contradictory results that \\ncan be classified into three categories: positive evidence, negative evidence, and null. While many explanations \\nhave been offered for the different sets of results, a matter that has remained unaddressed is the degree to which \\nadvantages and disadvantages coexist across tasks and populations, such that they possibly rise to a balanced \\nbilingual effect. This systematic review and two quantitative analyses addressed this question in a novel way, \\nthrough representing all the outcomes reported in the analyzed studies. First, we determined that there is strong \\nevidence for the presence of bilingual adaptations (in the form of both advantages and disadvantages) in the \\nanalyzed datasets, indicating that bilingualism is indeed more likely than not to exert effects on cognition. Sec -\\nond, our quantitative analyses showed that the data support the hypothesis that positive and negative outcomes \\nare equally plentiful. This finding is in agreement with previous meta-analyses that find more advantages than \\ndisadvantages in the executive  domain19,75,76, because—under the trade-off approach we have laid out—any pos-\\nsible executive function advantages are likely offset in other cognitive domains, including possible disadvantages \\nin verbal processing tasks.\\nWe have argued that this equilibrium may not be accidental. The distribution of effects suggests that the terms \\n“bilingual advantage” and “bilingual disadvantage” should not be conceived as stand-alone effects, forming a \\nsingle “advantage/disadvantage” pair, but possibly as inseparable parts of an overall trade-off that comes in dif -\\nferent guises and forms (e.g., accuracy vs. flexibility of switching, accuracy vs. speed, affected lexical retrieval \\nvs. enhanced pragmatic monitoring, etc.). From this perspective, advantages in some cognitive measures will \\nresult in disadvantages in others, playing a zero-sum game that can be best explained through assuming dynamic \\ntrade-offs. The effects subsumed under the labels “advantage” and “disadvantage” offset each other in a way that \\nmakes them subject to change under the influence of environmental factors such as time and developmental \\nstage. To conclude, while reasoning in fixed terms may be convenient, not recognizing the composite nature of \\nboth bilingualism and its effects would pose an unnecessary limit to our understanding of bilingual cognition. It \\nis likely that future research on the topic will address the remaining open questions (cf.33) while controlling for \\nresearch practices so as to reflect the diversity of bilingualism (cf.77),\\xa0and develop a theory of the characteristics \\nof the bilingual trade-offs, hopefully as part of an overall theory of cognitive adaptations to bilingualism that \\naddresses the factors that drive the observed effects.\\nData availability\\nAll data associated to the current study are available in this published article and in the OSF project, https:// osf.  \\nio/ 8w6ux/ .\\nReceived: 7 July 2023; Accepted: 18 January 2024\\nReferences\\n 1.

This has led more than 7.3 million\\nVenezuelans to emigrate, at least 1.5 million of those to Peru, which amounted to an increase of over 4\\npercent in the Peruvian population. Venezuelan immigrants in Peru are relatively similar in cultural terms,\\nbut, on average, more skilled than Peruvians. In this paper, we first examine Venezuelans’ perceptions of\\nbeing discriminated against in Peru. Using an instrumental variable strategy, we document a causal relationship\\nbetween the level of employment in the informal sector – where most immigrants are employed – and reports of\\ndiscrimination. We then study the impact of Venezuelan migration on local’s labor market outcomes, reported\\ncrime rates, and attitudes using a variety of data sources. We find that inflows of Venezuelans to particular\\nlocations led to increased employment and income among locals, decreased reported crime, and improved\\nreported community quality. We conduct a heterogeneity analysis to identify the mechanisms behind these\\nlabor market effects and discuss the implications for Peruvian immigration policy.\\n1. Introduction\\nCrisis-driven migration flows have significantly increased in the past\\ntwo decades ( Bhabha , 2018 ). The arrival of a large number of migrants\\nand refugees has triggered fierce political disputes over its impact on\\nlocal labor markets and has been at the center of much discussion in the\\nacademic literature and in the media. While locals’ perceptions about\\nthe effects of immigration on the labor market determine their behavior\\nand attitudes towards immigrants, the way in which these perceptions\\nare formed is less well understood.\\nIn this paper, we study the economic underpinnings of hostility\\nand discrimination against Venezuelan immigrants in Peru prior to the\\nCovid-19 pandemic.1The current crisis in Venezuela has led about\\n7.3 million people to emigrate ( R4V, 2023 ). This migration wave\\nintensified in 2017, when political instability added to the worsening\\neconomic situation in the country.

The pull factors were strengthened by the fact that the Pe-\\nruvian government facilitated the legal immigration of Venezuelans.\\nThis large inflow of immigrants potentially put pressure on local labor\\nmarkets, especially in urban areas, and increased the negative public\\ndiscourse against immigrants in the media ( Freier et al. , 2021 ; Winter ,\\n2020 ). Some of these sources not only claimed that the large wave of\\nnewcomers had led to an increase in unemployment, but also that it\\nhad contributed to an upsurge in urban violence.\\nStudying the economic underpinnings of discrimination against mi-\\ngrants is typically hard since large migration waves affect the dynamics\\nof the labor market, and the latter, in turn, affects discrimination.

Groeger et al.\\nidentify the causal effect of labor market outcomes on discrimination,\\nas well as the effects of migration on the labor market. In this paper, we\\nuse a specialized survey of Venezuelan immigrants in Peru to identify\\nthe causal effect of the quality of local labor markets on discrimina-\\ntion against immigrants. Then, we turn to the economic determinants\\nof attitudes towards immigrants and study the flip side of the first\\nanalysis, namely, how the presence of immigrants affects Peruvians’\\nlabor market outcomes, overall criminal activity, and their percep-\\ntions of crime and their local community. In both analyses, the main\\nidentification issue is that Venezuelans are not randomly allocated to\\nspecific locations in Peru and hence unobserved characteristics of both\\nthe location and the Venezuelans there might be correlated with local\\neconomic conditions and individual outcomes for both Venezuelans and\\nPeruvians in the same location. We account for this using different\\ninstrumental variables strategies combined with detailed controls on\\nthe local economic environment.\\nIn the first part of the analysis, we examine whether Venezuelans\\nwho live in local areas with a stronger informal labor market experience\\ndifferent levels of discrimination. A large majority of Venezuelans arriv-\\ning in Peru have taken up jobs in the informal sector, directly compet-\\ning with relatively low-skilled native workers. To causally identify the\\nrelationship, we use a shift-share instrumental variable strategy that ex-\\nploits local exposure to exogenous national-level export shocks (Jaeger\\net al., 2018). As informal employment and discrimination could both\\nbe related to other local characteristics, we also control for the local\\nindustrial structure, household expenditure, population size, distance\\nfrom the capital and center of economic activity (Lima), and, impor-\\ntantly, the number of Venezuelans based in each location prior to the\\ncurrent immigration wave, which we show to be a significant pull factor\\nfor where Venezuelans choose to settle.\\nOur results show that weaker informal labor markets lead to a\\nsignificant increase in the discrimination reported by Venezuelans in\\nPeru. A 10% increase in the informal employment rate decreases dis-\\ncrimination by 6.6%, on aggregate. This effect is larger for men than\\nfor women, with 7% and 5.8%, respectively. To put these numbers\\ninto perspective, a 10% increase in the informal employment rate\\nis equivalent to moving from the first to the third quartile of the\\ndistribution of informal employment rates across districts. The data\\nwe use also collects information on where discrimination occurs. We\\nfind that weaker informal labor markets lead to more discrimination\\nagainst men in public places and on public transit. Instead, we do\\nnot find evidence of an impact on workplace discrimination for either\\ngender. This suggests that weaker informal labor markets generate\\ngeneralized discrimination, rather than one that is workplace-based.\\nOne interesting pattern is that more educated Venezuelans are more\\nlikely to report being discriminated against when informal employment\\ndecreases. A potential explanation for this, which is consistent with\\nthe previous results, is that higher-skilled Venezuelans are disappointed\\nwith their situation in Peru, especially when they settle in areas with\\nweak informal labor markets, and the lack of opportunity is either\\ncaused by or perceived as discrimination (Guerrero-Ble et al., 2020).\\nWe then turn to examine the impact of immigration (as mea-\\nsured by changes in the number of Venezuelans as a share of the\\nlocal population) on labor market outcomes and locals’ perceptions\\non the current situation. We rely on administrative data to measure\\nthe number of Venezuelans newly registered in each district in Peru\\non a monthly basis between January 2015 and December 2020. We\\naggregate this information at the labor market level and rely on a time-\\nvarying measure of the presence of Venezuelans in each labor market,\\nwhich allows us to use repeated cross-sectional data on outcomes for\\nPeruvians and control for location and time fixed effects, as well as,\\nlocation-specific time trends. Hence, we identify the impact of the\\npresence of Venezuelans by examining how outcomes for Peruvians\\nchange when more Venezuelans arrive in a labor market, conditional\\non the trend in the outcome.It is possible that local shocks impact both the destination choice of\\nVenezuelans and outcomes for Peruvians, we thus use an instrumental\\nvariable strategy where we instrument the number of Venezuelans in\\na location with the presence of Venezuelans in that location in the\\npast, interacted with the year of observation. This is a semi-parametric\\nversion of the traditional migrant network instrument, as recommended\\nby Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020), and allows the strength of the net-\\nwork effect to potentially vary by year. An overidentification test can be\\nused to examine whether the instrument has a consistent relationship\\nover time.\\nWe find robust evidence that increased immigration from Venezuela\\nhas a positive impact on labor market outcomes for Peruvians, with\\nincreased employment rates, incomes, and expenditures. Additionally,\\nlocations that receive more immigrants have lower levels of reported\\nnon-violent crime, improved reported quality of local services, greater\\nreported trust in neighbors, and higher reported community quality.\\nOn the other hand, we find evidence that in locations with more\\nVenezuelans, Peruvians report that their community likes diversity less.\\nTaken together, our results imply that local labor markets in Peru\\nthat are more informal are better able to adapt to large migration\\ninflows both in terms of migrant assimilation and the impacts on\\nlocals. While the migration of Venezuelans to Peru is quite specific,\\nthis evidence suggests that there are perhaps unexpected downsides to\\nlabor market formalization in less-developed countries.\\nOur main contribution is to the recent literature on the impact\\nof crisis-driven migration in less developed countries.2A large group\\nof studies in this literature has focused on examining the impact of\\nSyrian refugee immigration on natives in Turkey and Jordan. The\\nresults show that these inflows of migrants and refugees reduce the\\nemployment and wages of low-skilled natives (Ceritoglu et al., 2017;\\nDel Carpio & Wagner, 2015; Tumen, 2016). There is also a growing\\nliterature studying the effects of the current Venezuelan exodus on\\nneighboring countries in Latin America. Results are more mixed than\\nin the Syrian case, and the diversity of the findings appear to relate to\\nthe conditions in the receiving economy.3Unlike most of the previous\\nstudies which find negative or null effects, we find that inflows of\\nVenezuelans to Peru lead to positive labor market effects for natives in\\ngeneral, with increased employment, incomes, and expenditures among\\nPeruvian households. We conduct a heterogeneity analysis by natives’\\ngender and skill level to shed light on the mechanisms behind this\\neffect: the results suggest that the effects stem mainly from increased\\ninformal employment among secondary-educated men and increased\\nformal employment among tertiary-educated men. High-skilled women\\nalso seem to benefit through increases in employment, potentially\\nas a result of improved child care services provided by Venezuelan\\nimmigrants.\\n2While there is a long-standing and rich literature in economics concerned\\nwith the effects of immigration on labor markets in developed countries (Bor-\\njas, 1983; Card, 2001), much less work has looked at the impact of (forced)\\nmigration in developing countries. For a general review of the literature of\\nthe impact of forced migration on host communities, see Verme and Schuettler\\n(2021).\\n3For Colombia, existing studies have mostly identified negative (Bahar\\net al., 2021; Delgado-Prieto, 2021; Lebow, 2020; Lebow et al., 2021) or\\nnull effects (Santamaria, 2022) on labor market outcomes of native workers.\\nFor Ecuador, Olivieri et al. (2020) do not find any effects on natives’ labor\\nmarket outcomes on average, but identify a deterioration of employment\\nquality and earnings among young and low-educated natives in high im-\\nmigration regions. For Peru, Boruchowicz et al. (2021) find null effects,\\nwhereas (Morales & Pierola, 2020) find small positive effects on formal\\nemployment for high-skilled and negative effects on employment and monthly\\nearnings for secondary educated natives and those with informal jobs. Vera\\nand Jiménez (2022) find evidence of a substitution of formal with informal\\nemployment among natives in Peru in reaction to Venezuelan immigration.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Groeger et al.\\nWe also contribute to the literature on the effects of immigra-\\ntion on popular opinion and discrimination. While most of the liter-\\nature concentrates on developed countries (e.g., Alesina et al. , 2022 ;\\nHangartner et al. , 2019 ), there is only a small literature on the ef-\\nfects of the Venezuelan exodus on popular opinion in Latin America.\\nFor Chile, Ajzenman et al.

Exploiting rich opinion polls,\\nwe contribute to this literature by estimating the causal impact of\\nmigration on both attitudes and perceptions of natives and immigrants\\nin the same context.\\nAnother important contribution of this study is to the nascent\\nliterature using digital trace data for measurement of migration ( Böhme\\net al. , 2020 ; Hausmann et al. , 2018 ; Palotti et al. , 2020 ; Santamaria ,\\n2022 ). One of the main difficulties in examining the impact of forced\\nmigration in host countries is typically the lack of data on where mi-\\ngrants are settling. To solve this issue, we develop a publicly available\\nGoogle Trends proxy for the concentration of Venezuelan immigrants\\nacross Peruvian regions. We then estimate our preferred specification\\nusing this proxy – instead of the administrative data from Peruvian\\nauthorities – and compare the results obtained. We find that the results\\nfrom the two approaches are surprisingly similar, both in qualitative\\nand quantitative terms. We believe that our approach can be directly\\napplied to measure the local presence of Venezuelan immigrants in\\nother major host economies. Furthermore, the proposed method can\\nbe adapted flexibly to help measure other immigrant concentrations in\\nany country by varying the choice of keywords adequately. Our study\\ncan therefore help ease data limitations affecting immigration studies\\nin general.\\nThe paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe the context\\nand institutional background. Section 3 describes the data we use in\\nour analysis as well as our empirical model and identification strategy.\\nWe then present the results in Section 4, and finally we discuss policy\\nimplications and conclude in Section 5.\\n2. Background\\nVenezuela is currently experiencing the biggest crisis in recent\\nhistory. A deep economic, political and humanitarian crisis started\\nramping up with the fall in oil prices and the death of former president\\nHugo Chavez in 2013 ( Chaves-González & Echevarría Estrada , 2020 ).\\nThis has led to what some authors have called the great Venezuelan\\nexodus ( Hausmann et al. , 2018 ; Rozo & Vargas , 2021 ). In mid-2016,\\nlarge waves of migrants started to leave the country, by 2019, the main\\ndestination of migrants were Colombia (1’700,000), Peru (870,000),\\nEcuador (385,000), and Chile (371,000) (data reported in Boruchowicz\\net al. (2021 ) up to June 2019). According to recent estimates, there\\nare a total of 7.3 million Venezuelan immigrants worldwide, and the\\nnumber of Venezuelans living in Peru has increased from 6615 in 2016\\nto more than 870,000 by June 2019 (see Fig. 1), and went up to\\nover 1.5 million by 2023 ( R4V, 2023 ). This wave of immigration has\\nincreased Peru’s population by over 4 percent.\\nTraveling from Venezuela to Peru entails a journey of over 4500\\nkilometers, and before 2017 Peruvian authorities required all immi-\\ngrants to be in possession of a passport (without any visa requirements).\\nHowever, obtaining a passport in Venezuela at the time was difficult,\\nas processing times were extremely long and required high fees. In\\nlight of this situation, in 2017, the Peruvian government made it easier\\n4On the effects of immigration on crime, see also: Bell et al. (2013 )\\nand Bianchi et al. (2012 ).\\nFig. 1.

This permit allowed immigrants to legally work and\\nstudy in the country, pay taxes, and open a bank account. According\\nto the national statistical institute (INEI), 50.2% of Venezuelan immi-\\ngrants applied for the PTP and were waiting for the decision, while\\n26.7% reported having obtained it before the ENPOVE survey interview\\nin February 2018 ( Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática ,\\n2019 ). Given the fact that PTP applicants were legally allowed to stay\\nin Peru and that most applications in 2018 were successful up to that\\npoint, the large majority of Venezuelan immigrants had a legal status\\nin Peru and were able to work in the informal or formal sector.\\nUnlike in other episodes of crisis migration, such as that of Syrian\\nrefugees during the recent civil war or Central American immigrants in\\nthe US, Venezuelan immigrants are not only very similar to Peruvians\\nin cultural terms, but are, on average, also more skilled than Peruvians.\\nAs of December 2018, 47.8% of Peruvians had less than secondary\\neducation which was true of only 17.2% of Venezuelan immigrants\\n(see Table 1). However, there is anecdotal evidence that Peruvians\\nview Venezuelans as contributing little to the economy and that their\\npresence in the country has increased criminal activities ( Janetsky ,\\n2019 ). Furthermore, there is some evidence that this has started to lead\\nto political backlash ( Winter , 2020 ).\\nBefore the pandemic, the Peruvian economy was averaging around\\na 5% annual growth rate, which made it an attractive destination for\\nmigrants. Moreover, the labor market is highly informal (and therefore\\nflexible): in 2018, only 21% of Peruvians held a formal job. Boruchow-\\nicz et al. (2021 ) show that the Venezuelan exodus had negligible effects\\non the Peruvian labor market, and argue that this is precisely due to\\nthe flexibility associated with the high levels of informality in the labor\\nmarket.5\\nVery little is known about the actual discrimination affecting\\nVenezuelan immigrants in the country. Still, it is plausible that part of\\nthe discrimination reported by immigrants is related to the way they are\\nportrayed in the media. Freier et al. (2021 ) provides a detailed analysis\\nof how the Peruvian written media has referred to Venezuelan immi-\\ngrants. They show that 46% of articles refer to Venezuelan immigrants\\nin a neutral fashion, while 28% (26%) have a negative (positive) tone.\\n5There is some contrasting evidence that the increase in Venezuelan\\nimmigrants in Peru led to small decreases in employment rates and earn-\\nings of low-skilled (and especially female) Peruvian workers in the informal\\nsector ( Asencios & Castellares , 2020 ; Morales & Pierola , 2020 ).', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Research design and data\\n3.1. Data\\nOur empirical analysis relies on an innovative combination of dif-\\nferent data sources ranging from the Peruvian census, immigrant and\\nlabor force surveys, opinion polls, and digital trace data:\\nEncuesta Dirigida a la Población Venezolana que Reside en El País (EN-\\nPOVE) is a specialized survey of Venezuelans living in Peru conducted\\nby the National Institute of Statistics (INEI) in December 2018. The\\nsample covers five main urban areas in the country where Venezuelan\\nimmigrants were most likely to be present. The survey collects data\\non the immigrant’s origin, migration date, and details on their current\\nemployment. Importantly, a full module asks about the immigrant’s\\nexperiences with locals, which includes questions about discrimination\\nand hostile attitudes towards them. The respondent’s current location is\\nidentified down to the centro poblado level, which roughly corresponds\\nto an urban neighborhood or a rural town. 48% of sample resides in\\nLima. We focus on variation in labor market opportunities at the district\\nlevel. Districts are the smallest administrative areas in Peru and are akinto counties in the US.6According to ENPOVE, 70% of Venezuelans work\\nin the same district in which they live.7\\nEncuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO) is the Peruvian version of the\\nLiving Standards Measurement Survey, e.g. a nationally representative\\nhousehold survey collected monthly on a continuous basis. For our\\nanalysis, we use data from January 2007 to December 2020. The\\nsurvey covers a wide variety of topics, including basic demographics,\\neducational background, labor market conditions, crime victimization,\\nand a module on respondent’s perceptions about the main problems in\\nthe country and trust on different local and national level institutions.\\nObservations are also spatially identified at the district level, but here\\nwe focus on variation in the Venezuelan share of the population at the\\nprovince level, of which there are 198, as these are best representative\\nof local labor markets for Peruvians.\\nLatin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) is a opinion survey con-\\nducted bi-annually in all countries in Latin America and designed to be\\nrepresentative of urban populations. This was fielded in Peru in 2010,\\n6Overall, there are 1857 districts in the country, which are grouped in 198\\nprovinces.\\n7ENPOVE does not cover enough provinces to examine cross-sectional\\nvariation at this geographical aggregation, as we do for our analysis of the\\nimpacts on Peruvians.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The survey questions are centered around\\npolitics, governance and opinions on current events. Observations are\\nalso spatially identified at the district level, and again we focus on\\nvariation in the Venezuelan share of the population at the province\\nlevel, the relevant labor market for Peruvians.\\nGallup World Poll (GWP) is a nationally representative opinion survey\\nand has been conducted annually since 2006 in a wide range of\\ncountries around the world. The sample collected in Peru is a repeated\\ncross-section of about approximately 1000 observations each year. For\\nour analysis, we use data from 2013 to 2020. The survey questions\\nare centered around politics, governance, and opinions on current\\nevents. We make use of several opinion indices provided by Gallup,\\nwhich measure individual opinions on various domains. Observations\\nare spatially identified at the region level for Peru, which is our level\\nof analysis in this case (there are 25 regions in Peru).\\nPTPWe measure the location of Venezuelan immigrants on a monthly\\nbasis from January 2015 to December 2020 using administrative data\\non the district Venezuelan immigrants register at with the Peruvian au-\\nthorities to obtain access to social services. There are strong incentives\\nto register as this is also a prerequisite for applying to obtain the PTP.\\nThis data only records monthly gross arrivals so we do not know the\\noutflows of Venezuelans to other locations within Peru or out of the\\ncountry. In ENPOVE, 84% of Venezuelan immigrants in Peru report\\nhaving lived in the same district during their entire time since arriving\\nin the country. The data shows the arrival of 511,223 Venezuelans as\\nof December 2020, which, while somewhat lower than estimates of the\\nactual number of Venezuelans living in Peru, is quite substantial.\\nWe also use data from the National Census 2007 and 2017 . We use\\nthe 2017 Census data to measure the share of workers in the formal\\nand informal sector in each district as well as the total local population\\nin each district, province and region. We use the 2007 data to construct\\nboth of our instruments (discussed in more detail below) as well as to\\ncreate additional controls for the local economic environment. More\\nprecisely, in the first part of our analysis, we use information on the\\nindustrial distribution (using detailed four-digit codes) in each district,\\nwhile in the second part, we use information on the total number of\\nVenezuelans in each province in Peru.\\nTo construct the Trade shock instrument for the first part of our\\nanalysis, we also use trade data from the reports of TradeMap. From\\nthis website, we are able to identify export and import values for Peru\\non a monthly basis since 2006 at the HS 6-digit product revision. In\\naddition, correspondence tables of HS 6-digit product revision to ISIC\\n3.1 revision (United Nations) are used to harmonize products with\\ntheir corresponding industry sector in order to be matched with census\\ndata. This allows us to create a year-ISIC panel with information about\\nexports and imports for 86 industry sectors in Peru.\\nWe also create a measure of Venezuelan immigrant concentration\\nusing Google Trends in different regions of Peru in each year to be used\\nas a robustness check. In the face of severe data limitations on immi-\\ngration in many countries, Google trends has recently been proposed\\nas a tool for the measurement and prediction of migration (Böhme\\net al., 2020). We select keywords that Venezuelan immigrants in Peru\\nsearch for through the Google search engine to proxy for immigrant\\nstocks at the regional level.8We expect these terms to be frequently\\nconsulted by all Venezuelan immigrants abroad (and not by Peruvians)\\nand, hence, their relative search frequencies to be indicative of the\\n8Particularly, we extract Google Trends at the region-year level for the\\ncombination of the following acronyms/keywords: ‘‘PTP’’ ( permiso temporal\\nde permanencia - work permit for immigrants in Peru), ‘‘SAIME’’ ( Servicio\\nAdministrativo de Identificación, Migración 𝑦Extranjería - Venezuelan agency for\\ncivil registry services including passport issuance for migrants abroad), and ‘‘La\\nPatilla’’ (Venezuelan news agency).distribution of Venezuelan immigration in Peru across regions and\\ntime. We follow Santamaria (2022) in calculating a relative measure\\nof Venezuelan immigrant concentration by region and year in Peru.\\nWe then use this measure in our preferred specification, replacing the\\nadministrative data on the location of Venezuelans to estimate the\\nimpact of Venezuelan immigration on Peruvian labor market outcomes.\\n3.2. Outcome variables\\nIn the first part of our analysis, we examine the impact of local\\nlabor market conditions on self-reported information on experiencing\\ndiscrimination as reported by Venezuelans surveyed in ENPOVE. Over-\\nall, 36.4% of Venezuelans report having experienced discrimination,\\nwith this being slightly more common among women (38.1%) than\\nmen (35.0%). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of reported discrimination\\nin different districts in Peru. There is clearly variation both across\\nand within regions. Report discrimination is least common in Tumbes\\n(23.4%), which is the typical entry point to Peru for Venezuelans and\\ncurrently hosts 5% of ENPOVE sample, while Cusco and Lima, where\\n7% and 48% of Venezuelans are located, show the highest (47.8%)\\nand median levels (37.1%) of reported discrimination, respectively.\\nIndividuals who experienced discrimination are then asked in which lo-\\ncations did the episode took place. Among all Venezuelans surveyed in\\nENPOVE, including those not reporting being discriminated against, the\\nthree most common locations are, at work (20.0%), on the streets/in\\npublic places (25.0%), and on public transit (9.8%).\\nIn the second part of our analysis, we examine the impact of\\nVenezuelans on a wide variety of outcomes for Peruvians. First, we ex-\\namine the impact on labor market outcomes, specifically employment,\\nformal employment, log wages if employed, log household income, and\\nlog household expenditure. Second, we examine the impact on reported\\ncrime and opinions about personal safety. Specifically, we look at the\\nreported (log) number of crimes in each district from administrative\\ndata split into non-violent and violent crimes (data starting in 2011,\\nmeans 3.54 for log violent crime and 3.31 for log non-violent crime),\\nfrom ENAHO whether crime is a major national problem (12.7%), from\\nLAPOP whether they have been a crime victim in the last two months\\n(32.0%), and standardized variables from LAPOP on opinions about\\nneighborhood safety and from Gallup on personal security. Lastly, we\\nexamine the impact on community outcomes. Specifically, we look at\\nstandardized indices measuring the quality of local services and trust in\\nneighbors from LAPOP and indices from Gallup on community attach-\\nment, the quality of the local community, and whether the community\\nlikes diversity.\\n3.3. Control variables\\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the control variables\\nused in each analysis. The information we have available from each\\ndataset varies, but we can always control for age, gender, education,\\nmarital status, whether employed, and household size. ENPOVE collects\\nadditional relevant data about Venezuelans including how long they\\nhave been in Peru, whether they work in the formal sector, their\\nlabor income, their occupation, and the socioeconomic status of their\\nhousehold. ENAHO collects very similar data from Peruvians. Neither\\nLAPOP nor Gallup collect detailed data on employment and occupation.\\nWe now describe our main explanatory variables.\\nIn the first analysis, the main explanatory variable is the informal\\nemployment rate measured in the 2017 census in the district in which\\nVenezuelans reside, which has a mean of 31.2%. This is noticeably\\nlower than the overall informal employment rate of 59.9% among\\nPeruvians surveyed in ENAHO, indicating that Venezuelans are gen-\\nerally settling in areas in Peru with less formal unemployment. Only\\n8.0% of Venezuelan immigrants surveyed in ENPOVE are employed in\\nthe formal sector (i.e., they have an employment contract with social\\nsecurity benefits), hence the employment rate in the informal sector', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Importantly, we also control for other local level economic\\ncharacteristics, such as the importance of agriculture and manufactur-\\ning, which could be related to both exposure to export shocks and\\nexperiencing discrimination.\\nWe then turn to examine the impact of receiving a larger population\\nof Venezuelan immigrants on natives’ labor market outcomes and\\ndifferent dimensions of locals’ perceptions. To do this, we estimate the\\nfollowing regression:\\n𝑦𝑖𝑝𝑡=𝛼+𝛽𝑙𝑛(𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 )𝑝𝑡+𝛿𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑡+𝛼𝑡+𝛼𝑝+𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 ∗𝛼𝑝+𝜀𝑖𝑝𝑡(3)\\nwhere𝑦𝑖𝑝𝑡represent a particular outcome for individual 𝑖living in\\nprovince𝑝interviewed at time 𝑡,𝑙𝑛(𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 )𝑝𝑡is the (log) of the\\nnumber of Venezuelan immigrants in province 𝑝at time𝑡as a share of\\nthe total population of province 𝑝in December 2017, and 𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑡include\\na series of individual level controls, including age, education, marital\\nstatus, and household size for all models, and employment status and\\noccupation for non-labor market outcomes measured in ENAHO. 𝜀𝑖𝑝𝑡is\\nan error term clustered at the province level, as we measure the number\\nof Venezuelan immigrants at this level and suspect there is strong serial\\ncorrelation in many of our outcomes.\\n11Our results are qualitatively similar if we instead control for the number\\nof Venezuelans living in each district in 2007 in levels.\\n12To be more precise, this shift-share instrument is calculated as follows:∑𝑁\\n𝑘=1(𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑗𝑘(2007) ×𝛥𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑘). We first multiply the share of workers employed\\nin a particular industry in each district in the baseline year 2007 (the ‘‘shares’’)\\nby the national change in exports in that industry in the year prior to Oct\\n2017 (the ‘‘shifters’’). We then sum this up over all industries in each district\\nto create a measure of the predicted export shock in each district.Table 2\\nImpact of local labor market conditions on reported discrimination by Venezuelans.\\nOLS IV\\nOverall: Have felt discriminated −Mean outcome =0.364\\nLog local informal Emp rate 0.003 −0.002 −0.030 −0.660*\\n(0.095) (0.094) (0.085) (0.360)\\nF-stat weak identification 693\\nR-squared 0.023 0.032 0.071\\nObservations 7869 7869 7869 7869\\nMen: Have felt discriminated −Mean outcome =0.350\\nLog local informal Emp rate 0.059 0.059 0.044 −0.704**\\n(0.109) (0.108) (0.098) (0.345)\\nF-stat weak identification 318\\nR-squared 0.022 0.027 0.093\\nObservations 4176 4176 4176 4176\\nWomen: Have felt discriminated −Mean outcome =0.381\\nLog local informal Emp rate −0.060 −0.077 −0.120 −0.568\\n(0.108) (0.106) (0.104) (0.403)\\nF-stat weak identification 370\\nR-squared 0.027 0.042 0.101\\nObservations 3693 3693 3693 3693\\nSociodemographic characteristics Yes Yes Yes Yes\\nEmployment and Occupation No Yes Yes Yes\\nOrigin municipality FE No No Yes Yes\\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

One worry is that Venezuelans now may be attracted to\\nplaces for similar reasons as Venezuelans in 2007. However, being able\\nto control for province level fixed effects as well as long-run provincial\\ntrends should alleviate this concern as our IV strategy still focuses on\\nthe relationship between increased local inflows of Venezuelans over\\ntime and changes in labor market outcomes for Peruvians in the same\\nlocations.\\n4. Results\\n4.1. Labor market conditions and discrimination\\nTable 2 shows our main results on the effects of local labor mar-\\nket conditions on self reported discrimination. We first present the\\nOLS results, and then turn to comment on the estimates from our IV\\nspecification. Importantly, given that the types of jobs in which men\\nand women work differ, we show the main results for the full sample\\nof immigrants who responded to the survey and split the sample by\\ngender.\\nColumns (1)–(3) show the OLS relationship between the (log) local\\ninformal employment rate and the reports of discrimination. In the\\nthree panels, this relationship shows small and insignificant coeffi-\\ncients. As discussed above, these OLS results cannot be interpreted\\nas causal due to an endogeneity issue that arises from the fact that\\nimmigrants make their location decisions based on the local labor\\nmarket conditions. To overcome this problem, we use an instrumental\\nvariable strategy in which we exploit exogenous variation in the impact\\nof national level export shocks on local (informal) employment rates\\ndepending on detailed measures of the local industry composition.\\nSpatial variation in both the informal employment rate in 2017 and\\nthe instrument are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Importantly,\\nthere is clear variation in both dimensions, across and within regions.\\nThe first stage relationship is shown graphically in Fig. 5. An increase inpredicted local exports has a positive relationship with formal employ-\\nment rates. Consequently, higher predicted exports imply that a lower\\nshare of people work in the informal sector, where most Venezuelan\\nimmigrants are employed. The full results of the first stage relationship\\nbetween export shocks and informal employment rates are provided\\nin Table A.1. Using a linear specification for the first stage yields a\\nvery strong instrument, with an F-stat for the excluded instrument that\\nranges between 318 and 693, even while controlling for a number of\\nother measures of the local economic environment.\\nColumn (4) in Table 2 shows the second stage results from our\\nIV strategy. The first thing to note is that the IV coefficient is much\\nlarger than the OLS one. This difference indicates that Venezuelan\\nimmigrants are selecting themselves into labor markets where there is\\nmore discrimination. This is consistent with the idea that immigrants\\nare willing to deal with more discrimination as long as the labor market\\noffers better opportunities and higher wages. The selection seems more\\nrelevant for men than for women.\\nHigher employment rates in the informal sector cause a reduction\\nin the level of discrimination reported by Venezuelan immigrants. On\\naverage, a 10 percent increase in informal employment in a district\\ncauses a 6.6% reduction in discrimination. Furthermore, the results\\nshow that men are more likely to suffer from discrimination due to\\nchanges in the informal employment rate: a 10% increase in employ-\\nment reduces discrimination against men by 7%, while for women, the\\npoint estimate indicates a decrease of 5.7% which, however, is not\\nstatistically significant.\\nImportantly, the reduction in discrimination as a response is not\\nexplained by having more exposure in the labor market: as we show\\nin Table A.2, variation in local informal employment is unrelated to\\nthe Venezuelan immigrants’ probability of being employed. While this\\nmay be a bit surprising, we have to take into account that 94% of\\nVenezuelan immigrants are employed, so there is little margin for\\nimprovement. Additionally, for men, we observe a negative effect on\\nwages with the point estimate indicating a reduction of 9.5% for a 10%', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We show the OLS and IV\\nresults for our preferred specification, the one that includes all controls\\nand fixed effects. Discrimination at work seems to respond the least to\\nlocal employment, with a coefficient that implies that a 10% increase\\nin informal employment leads discrimination to decrease by 2.8%,\\nalthough the relationship is not statistically significant. Interestingly,\\nthere is a clear gender split on whether discrimination occurs in streets\\nand public spaces. A 10% increase in informal employment causes a\\ndecrease in discrimination against men in streets and public spaces of\\nabout 10%, with no significant change in discrimination against women\\nin these spaces. Finally, discrimination in public transit responds sim-\\nilar regardless of the gender, with reductions of about 4.5%–5% in\\ndiscrimination for a 10% increase in the informal employment rate.\\nThese results are consistent with a situation in which weak local la-\\nbor markets create general resentment towards Venezuelan immigrants,\\nwhich leads to discrimination by people who do not share a work-\\nplace with Venezuelans. There are many reasons why this could then\\nlead to more perceived discrimination ‘on the streets’ and in ‘public\\ntransit’, rather than ‘at work’. One explanation in line with the inter-\\ngroup contact theory is that working with immigrants implies repeated\\ninteractions and typically creates a bond that can lead to reductions\\nin natives’ discriminatory attitudes towards immigrants (Steinmayr,\\n2021).14\\n14We also examined whether the results varied depending on how long\\nVenezuelans had been in Peru. We found that the impact of local labor markets\\nis larger for individuals (in particular men) who arrived more recently in Peru\\n(after February 2018). However, it is difficult to know how to interpret these\\nresults because of the potential changing selection of migrants over time, in\\nother words separating cohort and time in the country effects.4.2. Immigration and local’s labor market outcomes\\nIn the previous section, we established that labor market conditions\\nhave a causal effect on the way Venezuelan immigrants perceive to be\\ntreated by locals: lower unemployment in the informal labor market\\nleads to a decrease in discrimination. We now turn to study the flip-side\\nof this question, namely, the way in which the presence of Venezuelans\\naffect Peruvians’ labor market outcomes and their perceptions about\\ncrime, corruption, and public good provision at the local level. To\\nconduct this analysis we estimate Eq. (3).\\nTable 5 shows the results on the impact of the presence of Venezue-\\nlan immigrants on Peruvian’s labor market outcomes. We report our\\nOLS estimates with different sets of controls (Panels A and B). We\\nthen report our aggregate IV estimates (Panel C), along those from\\na subgroup specification by gender (Panels D and E, respectively). A\\nhigher number of Venezuelan immigrants in a given province corre-\\nlates with higher levels of employment (but not formal employment)\\nfor Peruvians once we include province and time fixed effects as\\nwell as province-specific trends (Panel B). Additionally, households in\\nprovinces with more immigrants report higher incomes and expen-\\nditures. As mentioned above, the OLS estimates may suffer from an\\nendogeneity problem, and the associations observed in Panels A and\\nB could be caused by the fact that immigrants sort into more dynamic\\nlabor markets.\\nWe introduce our instrumental variable estimates in Panel C of\\nTable 5. Recall that in these regressions we instrument the log share of\\nVenezuelans at the province-year level with the log share of Venezue-\\nlans in the same province in 2007 interacted with year dummies.

The results are presented in Table 6. Despite the\\ndifferences in the source and construction of the immigration measure,\\nthe IV results in Panel C are remarkably similar, both in qualitative and\\nquantitative terms. This suggests that measurement error and under-\\nreporting in the administrative data are not biasing our results. Perhaps\\nmore importantly, it also demonstrates that our approach is capable\\nof measuring Venezuelan immigration in Peru successfully and likely\\ncould be used in other contexts to obtain reliable causal estimates of\\nthe impact of immigration on natives’ labor market outcomes even in\\nthe absence of high-quality administrative data.\\nIn the last part of our analysis, we shed more light on the potential\\nmechanisms behind the positive effects of Venezuelan immigration on\\nPeruvian labor market outcomes. To this end, we conduct a heterogene-\\nity analysis by natives’ gender and skill level, the results of which are\\npresented in Table 7. Focusing on male labor market outcomes, we find\\nlarger impacts on the employment of medium- and high-skilled men\\n(with completed secondary or tertiary education, respectively), as well\\nas on income and expenditure. Interestingly, increased employment\\namong high-skilled men seems to be driven mainly by increased formal\\nemployment which is not the case for medium-skilled men.\\nFor women, the positive impacts on income and expenditure are\\nconcentrated among low and high-skilled individuals. For them, the\\nresults suggest that the effect is driven by increased (informal) em-\\nployment. For the low-skilled, wage information is missing for most\\nworkers, so increased income and expenditure could reflect increased\\nwages or hours of work or (as many of these women are not working\\nfull-time) increased earnings of their partner.\\nThe positive impact of Venezuelan immigration on Peruvian labor\\nmarket outcomes has a number of potential explanations. The arrival ofVenezuelans may have generally expanded the economic opportunities\\nfor Peruvian because of their higher levels of potential productivity,\\ndue to higher human capital and concentration in low wage jobs.\\nFurthermore, most of the informal jobs taken by Venezuelans are in the\\nservice sector which potentially could have freed up time, especially\\nfor Peruvian women to be more engaged in the labor market. This may\\nexplain the results for high skilled individuals in particular.\\n4.3. Immigration, crime and communities\\nOne widespread claim mentioned in some media reports is that\\nVenezuelan migration led to an increase in crime (Freier et al., 2021).\\nWe test whether this claim is supported by the data in Table 8, where\\nwe use administrative information on the number of non-violent and\\nviolent crimes reported in each municipality, the personal security\\nindex from Gallup, and reports on whether crime is perceived as a\\nmajor problem in ENAHO. The structure of this table is the same as\\nthe previous one, with Panel C as our preferred specification.\\nConsistent with the idea that Venezuelan inflow lead to improve-\\nments in labor market conditions, we observe that locations that re-\\nceived a larger number of immigrants have lower number of reported\\nnon-violent crimes (column 2). This effect is large with a double of\\nVenezuelans in a province leading to a 42% decline in reported non-\\nviolent crimes. Individuals are also less likely to report that crime is a\\nmajor national problem, this is true for both men and women.\\nFinally, in Table 9 we examine the effects of immigration on local\\ncommunities. Consistent with our previous findings, Peruvians living\\nin areas with a higher share of Venezuelan immigrants report that the\\nquality of local services and community quality are higher and that they\\nhave greater trust in their neighbors. However, in these locations they\\nalso report that the community is less likely to value diversity. In gen-\\neral, these findings are stronger for men than for women. It is important\\nto note that these findings could be driven by the positive impact that\\nVenezuelans have on the labor market outcomes of Peruvians.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Groeger et al.\\nOverall, we find that increased Venezuelan migration leads to im-\\nprovements in both objective and subjective measures of the lives of\\nPeruvians living in the same locations. This may explain why, even\\nthough some media has discussed Venezuelans in a negative light, there\\nhas been little political backlash against them in Peru up to this point\\nin time.\\n5. Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we study the economic underpinnings of hostility\\nand discrimination against immigrants. In our analysis, we first use\\na specialized survey of Venezuelan immigrants in Peru to identify the\\ncausal effect of local labor market conditions on discrimination against\\nimmigrants. Then, we study the flip-side of this analysis, namely, how\\ndoes the presence of Venezuelan immigrants affect Peruvians’ labor\\nmarket outcomes, local crime, and their perceptions about security and\\ntheir local community.\\nWe document a causal relationship between the level of employ-\\nment in the informal sector – where most immigrants are employed\\n– and reports of discrimination. While fears of political backlash and\\nanti-immigrant sentiment persist, we do not find any evidence that\\nVenezuelan immigration to Peru had negative labor market conse-\\nquences for Peruvians or led to increased crime. In fact, the opposite\\nseems to be true with higher local Venezuelan immigration leading to\\nlower crime rates and more educated natives benefiting from higher\\nemployment and income, while low-skilled natives remain generally\\nunaffected. These results stand in contrast to those published by the\\nPeruvian Central Bank that identify negative effects on employment\\nand earnings as a result of Venezuelan immigration, concentrated\\namong Peruvian women (Asencios & Castellares, 2020).\\nOur results suggest that recent policy changes by Peruvian authori-\\nties to limit regular immigration from Venezuela are unnecessary.15The\\nInternational Monetary Fund estimates that 0.4 percentage points of\\nPeruvian real GDP can be attributed to Venezuelan immigrants in 2021\\nand argues that ‘‘the long-term benefits of this migration episode will\\ndepend on the speed of labor market integration of entrants [...]’’ (IMF,\\n2020, p. 6). In light of these results, a better approach would be to\\nhelp facilitate their arrival, regularization, and (formal) labor market\\nintegration (Guerrero-Ble et al., 2020). This would help realize the\\nbenefits that the skilled Venezuelan labor force in Peru offers and\\npotentially generate higher incomes, yield greater fiscal revenues, and\\nalso generate support for Peru’s pension system.\\nBeyond this, taken together, our results imply that local labor\\nmarkets in Peru that are more informal are better able to adapt to large\\nmigration inflows both in terms of migrant assimilation and the impacts\\non locals. While the migration of Venezuelans to Peru is quite specific,\\nthis evidence suggests that there are perhaps unexpected downsides to\\nlabor market formalization in less-developed countries.\\nFinally, our study also highlights a novel approach for measuring\\nVenezuelan immigrant concentration across Peruvian regions using\\nGoogle Trend for Venezuelan-specific keywords. Comparing the causal\\nestimates based on this measure with those using our preferred measure\\nfrom administrative records, we obtain remarkably similar results. We\\nbelieve that the proposed approach holds promise to significantly ease\\ndata limitations for studies on the impact of immigration, especially in\\ndeveloping countries where reliable measures of immigrant settlement\\nare often unavailable.

A filamentous  and fluffy flocculant  material,  namely  slime-like  substances  \\n(SLS), was gradually  accumulated  in the bioreactor  after the cease of methanogenic  activity.  \\nThe accumulation  of SLS was followed  by a decrease  in the removal  efficiencies  and a de- \\nterioration  in the performance.  Selected  characteristics  of SLS were investigated  to explore  \\nthe causes of its formation  and the effect of SLS on the UASB performance.  Results  showed  \\nthat glycerol  fermentation  and sulfate reduction  processes  taking place in the reactor  were \\nmainly  accomplished  in the bottom  part of the UASB reactor,  as the sludge concentration  in \\nthe bottom  was higher.  The accumulation  of SLS in the UASB reactor  caused  sludge flota- \\ntion that further  led to biomass  washout,  which decreased  the sulfate and glycerol  removal  \\nefficiencies.  Batch activity  tests performed  with granular  sludge (GS), slime-covered  gran- \\nular sludge (SCGS) and SLS showed  that there was no difference  between  GS and SLS in \\nthe mechanism  of glycerol  fermentation  and sulfate reduction.  However,  the specific  sul- \\nfate reduction  rate of GS was higher than that of SLS, while SLS showed  a higher glycerol  \\nfermentation  rate than that of GS. The different  rates in GS and SLS were attributed  to the \\nhigher relative  abundances  of fermentative  microorganisms  found in SLS and higher rela- \\ntive abundances  of sulfate reducing  bacteria  (SRB) found in GS. \\n© 2023 The Research  Center for Eco-Environmental  Sciences,  Chinese  Academy  of \\nSciences.

The success  of the sul- \\nfate reduction  process  has been proven  using a variety  of car- \\nbon sources,  such as methanol  ( Vallero  et al., 2003 ), ethanol  \\n( Wu et al., 2018 ), butanol  ( Sarti and Zaiat, 2011 ), or crude glyc- \\nerol ( Fernández-Palacios  et al., 2019 ). Following  the sulfate  \\nreduction  to sulfide,  recovering  valuable  metals  from metal-  \\nsulfides  precipitation  has been applied  in full-scale  installa-  \\ntions by Paques  company  ( Huisman  et al., 2006 ). Further  par- \\ntial oxidation  of sulfide  to elemental  sulfur as a value-added  \\nproduct  to valorize  S-rich effluents  has also been reported  re- \\ncently ( Mora et al., 2020a ). \\nIn order to further  extend  the application  of valorizing  \\nsulfate-rich  effluents,  it is necessary  to improve  the robust-  \\nness of biological  processes  by stabilizing  the bioreactor,  op- \\ntimizing  operating  conditions  and avoiding  inhibitory  com- \\npounds  accumulation.  Management  strategies  that are insuf- \\nficiently  evaluated  may exacerbate  risks, which further  re- \\nsults in unexpected  process  failure  and economic  losses from \\ntheir commercial  application  ( Westerholm  et al., 2018 ). Sev- \\neral problems  have been identified  in the long-term  opera-  \\ntion of UASB reactors.  For example,  fat and oil attached  onto \\nthe biomass  or the high up-flow  velocity  has been reported  \\nto lead to sludge  flotation  and the washout  of biomass,  thus \\ndecreasing  the COD removal  efficiency  (RE) and leading  to \\nprocess  failure  ( Jeganathan  et al., 2006 ; Rizvi et al., 2015 ). \\nLu et al. (2015b)  also described  that the lack of consump-  \\ntion of excess  extracellular  polymeric  substances  produced  \\nand the biogas generated  in an UASB reactor  treating  starch-  \\nrich wastewater  resulted  in the flotation  of sludge  that was \\nnot able to settle, which eventually  led to sludge  washout  \\nand the clogging  of the outlet of the reactor.  The required  \\ncleaning  procedures  due to clogged  outlets  or the reinocula-  \\ntion of biomass  due to washout  increase  operating  costs. Fur- \\nthermore,  when treating  some specific  wastewater  (such as \\nmethanol-containing  wastewater)  in UASB reactors,  the dis- \\nintegration  of GS increased  the washout  of sludge,  which not \\nonly reduced  the quality  of the outlet and decreased  the COD \\nRE, but also increased  the risk of failure  ( Lu et al., 2015a ). \\nTherefore,  long-term  evaluation  of the stability  performance  \\nof reactors  for sulfate-rich  effluents  treatment  is needed.  \\nMany studies  have already  reported  several  factors  affect-  \\ning the anaerobic  treatment  of sulfate-rich  wastewaters  dur- \\ning the long-term  operation,  including  the carbon  source  type, \\ntemperature,  pH, sulfate  loading  rate and carbon  to sulfur \\n(C/S) ratio ( Lopes et al., 2007 ; Mora et al., 2020b ; Shin et al., \\n1996 ; Vallero  et al., 2004 ). Anaerobic  methanogenic  sludge  \\ncan be adapted  to sulfidogenic  conditions  in order to achieve  \\nthe treatment  of sulfate-rich  wastewaters  ( Lens et al., 2002 ). \\nHowever,  it can take a long time for SRB to outcompete  \\nmethanogens.  In order to adapt to the sulfate  reduction  condi- \\ntions, previous  studies  showed  some alternatives  to speed up \\nthe start-up  of the process  such as adding  a pure culture  of SRB \\n( Omil et al., 1997b ) or using SRB enriched-biomass  to target \\nspecific  organic  compounds  ( Kaksonen  and Puhakka,  2007 ). In addition,  an optimum  COD/S-SO  4 2 −ratio may also accelerate  \\nthe adaptation  period.  Fernández-Palacios  et al. (2019) inves- \\ntigated  different  sulfate  and organic  loading  rates in a sulfi- \\ndogenic  UASB reactor.  It took 30 days after the inoculation  of \\nthe reactor  to reach over 80% of sulfate  RE at COD/S-SO  4 2- ra- \\ntio of 3.8 g O 2 /g S-SO 4 2 −, while only 16 days after the inocula-  \\ntion, sulfate  RE reached  an 80% at COD/S-SO  4 2- ratio of 5.4 g \\nO 2 /g S-SO 4 2- and an organic  loading  rate of 15.8 kg O 2 /m 3 /day \\n( Fernández-Palacios  et al., 2021 ). Temperature  shocks  could \\nalso be a strategy  to speed up the process  of sulfidogenesis  \\noutcompetition  over methanogenesis  ( Jung et al., 2019 ). \\nIn addition,  sludge  granulation  is an indispensable  and \\ncritical  factor for the robust treatment  of wastewater.  Gran- \\nular biomass  makes  a significant  contribution  in maintain-  \\ning the dynamic  balance  and the stability  of reactors  oper- \\nation ( Lu et al., 2015a ). However,  some studies  found that \\nnon-granular  particles  were formed  during  sulfate  reduction  \\nprocesses.  For example,  Vallero  et al. (2003) reported  the for- \\nmation  of thin fluffy flocculent  particles  in the treatment  \\nof synthetic  wastewater  containing  methanol  and sulfate  in \\nan UASB reactor  inoculated  with GS. Similarly,  granules  were \\ndisintegrated  and filamentous  and fluffy particles  aggregated  \\nin an expanded  GS bed reactor  for sulfate  reduction  using \\nmethanol  ( Weijma  et al., 2000 ). Weijma  et al. (2000) reported  \\nnegative  effects  of sulfate  reduction  on granulation.  How- \\never, there is a lack of previous  studies  in the characteriza-  \\ntion of fluffy flocculent  particles,  their formation  and poten-  \\ntial effects  on bioreactor  performance  as often they are not \\npositive.  \\nWhen acetate,  cheese  whey, pig slurry, crude glycerol  and \\nvinasses  were selected  as carbon  sources  for sulfate  reduc-  \\ntion process,  crude glycerol  showed  better results  and it was \\nthe most promising  carbon  source  to reduce  sulfate  compared  \\nwith others tested carbon  sources  ( Mora et al., 2018 ). Crude \\nglycerol  is an inexpensive  by-product  mainly  produced  in the \\nbiodiesel  production  industry.  Approximately,  0.1 kg of crude \\nglycerol  is produced  per kg of biodiesel  ( Kumar  et al., 2019 ). As \\na way to valorize  this waste product  from the biodiesel  indus-  \\ntry, crude glycerol  has been applied  in many processes  such as \\nthe bioconversion  of glycerol  to biodiesel  ( Chen et al., 2018 ), \\nmethane  production  and hydrogen  production  in anaerobic  \\ndigestion  ( Baba et al., 2013 ), composting  ( Fehmberger  et al., \\n2020 ) and sulfate  reduction  ( Mora et al., 2020a , 2020b ). How- \\never, in a previous  study ( Fernández-Palacios  et al., 2021 ), \\nthe long-term  performance  of an UASB to treat sulfate-rich  \\nwastewater  using crude glycerol  as a carbon  source  lead to the \\ndecrease  of sulfate  and organic  compounds  removal  efficien-  \\ncies, accompanied  by the accumulation  of a sticky flocculent  \\nSLS that surrounded  the granular  biomass.  The present  work \\naims at characterizing  such SLS that accumulated  in the UASB \\nreactor,  exploring  the causes  of its formation  and the effect \\nthat this substance  can have on the stability  of the UASB per- \\nformance  over long-term  periods.

Materials  and methods  \\n1.1. Experimental  setup of the sulfidogenic  UASB reactor  \\nA 2.5 L UASB reactor  was used for the treatment  of sulfate-rich  \\nwastewater  using crude glycerol  as carbon  source  to produce  \\nsulfide.  Six sampling  ports located  along the UASB reactor  (at \\n7, 20, 30, 45, 54 and 72 cm from the bottom  to the top of the \\nUASB),  named  UASB1  to UASB6,  respectively,  were used to col- \\nlect samples  along the height of the reactor  during  its long- \\nterm operation.  A schematic  diagram  of the process  is pre- \\nsented  in Appendix  A Fig. S1. The UASB reactor  was operated  \\nunder constant  conditions  for 639 days, and the sulfate  inlet \\nconcentration  was set to 250 mg S-SO 4 2 −/L, while the crude \\nglycerol  to sulfate  ratio (TOC/sulfate)  was steadily  maintained  \\nat 1.5 ±0.3 g C/g S. Detailed  operating  conditions  of the UASB \\nreactor  are presented  in Appendix  A Table S1. GS to inoculate  \\nthe reactor  was obtained  from a full-scale  anaerobic  UASB di- \\ngester from a pulp and paper recycling  industry  (UIPSA,  Spain).  \\nThe initial volatile  suspended  solids (VSS) concentration  of \\nGS was 27.1 g VSS/L. However,  the UASB reactor  accumulated  \\nviscous,  flocculent  SLS along the operation,  which are shown  \\nin Appendix  A Fig. S2. UASB dimensions,  equipment,  mineral  \\nmedium  composition  and crude glycerol  characteristics  are \\nfurther  detailed  in Fernández-Palacios  et al. (2021) . \\n1.2. Assessment  of stratification  in the UASB reactor  \\nThe stratification  of the UASB reactor  was assessed  by col- \\nlecting  samples  from six sampling  ports of the UASB reactor  \\nunder two different  situations:  on day 198, when the reactor  \\nwas properly  operating  under sulfidogenic  conditions,  and on \\nday 575, when a large amount  of SLS had already  accumu-  \\nlated in the reactor  and sulfate  RE were dramatically  reduced.  \\nThe analysis  of the inlet, outlet and the sampling  ports of the \\nreactor  included  monitoring  of sulfate,  thiosulfate,  total dis- \\nsolved  sulfide  (TDS), volatile  fatty acids (VFAs),  glycerol,  total \\norganic  carbon  (TOC), total inorganic  carbon  (TIC) and total \\ncarbon  (TC). The calculating  process  of volumetric  rates and \\nmean cell residence  time (MCRT)  are presented  in Appendix  \\nA supplementary  methods.  The sludge  particle  size was as- \\nsessed  at different  bed heights  of the UASB reactor  (UASB1,  \\nUASB2  and UASB3)  on days 50, 149 and 230, where the parti- \\ncle size distribution  (PSD) and the median  diameter  of sludge  \\nparticles  (D(0.5))  were detected.  D(0.5) was chosen,  because  the \\nmedian  is relatively  unaffected  by skewed  distributions  or ex- \\ntreme scores at end of distribution,  compared  to the mean \\n( Field, 2013 ). \\n1.3. Batch tests \\nSince VFAs (mainly  acetate  and propionate)  are reported  as \\nthe most common  intermediate  products  of glycerol  degra- \\ndation  ( Bertolino  et al., 2014 ; Dinkel  et al., 2010 ; Mora et al., \\n2020b ; Zhou et al., 2022 ); acetate,  propionate  and glycerol  were \\nused as carbon  sources  to study the sulfate  reduction  process  \\nin batch tests. In order to study whether  the decrease  of the \\nsulfate  RE in the UASB reactor  was due to the presence  of \\nSLS, sludge  was collected  from the UASB reactor  on day 315 (when SLS covered  GS) and on day 431 (when a large amount  \\nof SLS had already  accumulated  in the reactor),  as shown  in \\nAppendix  A Fig. S2. Table 1 summarizes  the operating  condi- \\ntions of activity  tests performed  with different  carbon  sources.  \\nThe sludge  collected  from UASB1  on day 315 was separated  \\ninto GS and slime-covered  granular  sludge  (SCGS)  (Appendix  A \\nFig. S3). The SCGS was the sludge  taken directly  from the reac- \\ntor without  any treatment,  which contained  GS covered  with \\nSLS, whereas  GS was granular  sludge  that had been cleaned  to \\nremove  SLS. The cleaning  process  is presented  in Appendix  A \\nSupplementary  data. 150 mL of mineral  medium  were fed to \\nboth GS and SCGS, and acetate  and propionate  were added as \\ncarbon  sources.  The initial concentrations  were set to main- \\ntain the same conditions  as the TOC/S ratio used along the \\nlong-term  UASB operation.  \\nDue to the low concentration  of GS at UASB1,  where almost  \\nall the biomass  was completely  surrounded  by SLS (Appendix  \\nA Fig. S2C) on day 431, the sludge  collected  by that time was \\nfrom UASB6.  The sludge  collected  from UASB6  on day 431 was \\ndivided  into GS and SLS. The GS and SLS were fed with 150 mL \\nof mineral  medium  and pure glycerol  (99%, Panreac,  Spain) as \\nthe carbon  source.  \\nOnce the sludge,  mineral  medium  and carbon  sources  were \\nadded to the serum bottles,  the gas phase of the bottles  was \\nrefilled  with N 2 . Then bottles  were immediately  covered  with \\nrubber  stoppers  and aluminum  caps and incubated  at 35 ±1 °C \\nand 150 r/min in a constant  temperature  shaker  (NB-T205,  N- \\nBiotek).  All batch tests were carried  out in duplicate.  \\n1.4. Analytical  methods  \\nSulfur compounds  analyzed  included  sulfate,  thiosulfate  and \\nTDS. TDS was analyzed  off-line  by a sulfide  selective  elec- \\ntrode (9616BNWP,  Thermo  Scientific,  USA) connected  to a \\nbenchtop  meter (Symphony,  VWR, USA). Before TDS measure-  \\nments,  samples  were diluted  one-to-two  for UASB samples  \\nand one-to-twenty  for activity  tests samples  with a sulfide  \\nantioxidant  buffer (SAOB),  which composition  is described  by \\nMora et al. (2020a)  . Sulfate  and thiosulfate  were analyzed  by \\nion chromatography  (ICS-2000  system,  Dionex,  USA) with a \\nsuppressed  conductivity  detector  using an IonPac  AS18-HC  \\ncolumn  (4 ×250 mm, Dionex,  USA). Prior to the analysis  of \\nsulfate  and thiosulfate,  samples  were bubbled  with nitrogen  \\nto avoid chemical  oxidation  of sulfide  and diluted  to one fifth \\nwith ultrapure  water. \\nPrior to the analysis  of carbon  compounds,  samples  were \\nalso bubbled  with nitrogen.  Volatile  fatty acids (VFAs) and \\nalcohols  (ethanol,  1,3-propanediol,  n-butanol,  2,3-butanediol)  \\nwere measured  by high-performance  liquid chromatography  \\n(HPLC,  Ultimate  3000, Dionex,  USA) equipped  with an ICSep \\nICE-CPREGEL  87H3 column  (7.8 mm ×150 mm) and a variable  \\nwavelength  detector  at 210 nm with a 6 mmol/L  H 2 SO 4 mo- \\nbile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.  Samples  for VFAs and \\nalcohols  were not diluted.  \\nTotal organic  carbon  (TOC), total inorganic  carbon  (TIC) and \\ntotal carbon  (TC) were determined  in a TOC analyzer  (multi \\nN/C 2100S, analytikjena,  Germany)  equipped  with a furnace  \\nat the catalytic  high-temperature  of 850 °C.

GS and SLS \\nwere separated  and manually  transferred  to a new falcon \\ntube where distilled  water was added.  The centrifugation  \\nprocess  was repeated  2 to 4 times until GS and SLS were \\nseparated  in the falcon tubes. Then, GS and SLS were sep- \\narated by plastic  pipettes.

Stratification  and long-term  performance  of the \\nUASB reactor  \\nThe UASB reactor  was operated  under a constant  sulfate  load- \\ning rate of 5.0 ±0.6 kg S/m 3 /day and an organic  loading  rate of 7.3 ±1.6 kg C/m 3 /day for 639 days. The gas production  rate \\nin the UASB and the sulfate,  TOC and glycerol  RE are pro- \\nvided in Fig. 1 to illustrate  the UASB performance.  Further,  \\nmore complete  details  of the experimental  performance  re- \\nsults of the UASB reactor  can be found elsewhere  ( Fernández-  \\nPalacios  et al., 2021 ). In brief, the operation  was divided  into \\nfour periods:  stage I, from day 0 to day 16, corresponding  to the \\nstart-up  and GS adaptation  period;  stage II, from day 16 to day \\n100, corresponding  to a period with a stable sulfate  reduction  \\nwith methane  production;  stage III, from day 100 to day 280, \\nunder stable sulfate  reduction  without  methane  production;  \\nand stage IV, from day 280 to day 639, when a decline  in the \\nsulfate  RE and glycerol  RE occurred.  After the adaptation  pe- \\nriod, stable sulfate  RE higher  than 83% were achieved  on stage \\nII and stage III and it decreased  to 38.8% on stage IV. In terms \\nof carbon,  over 97% of glycerol  RE was observed  on stage I, II \\nand III, but it decreased  to 64% on stage IV. It can be observed  \\nthat the TOC RE was positively  correlated  with the gas produc-  \\ntion. When the gas production  rate was higher  than 60 mL/hr,  \\nthe TOC RE was higher  than 86% on stage I and II. A progres-  \\nsive decrease  in the gas production  was accompanied  by the \\ndecrease  of TOC RE on stage II and III. The pH in the outlet of \\nthe UASB reactor  was maintained  at 7.0-7.3  (Appendix  A Fig. \\nS4). \\nDuring  stages II and III, a progressive  degranulation  of the \\nsludge  was observed  when methanogenic  activity  stopped.  \\nSludge  particle  size distribution  over the operation  period is \\nshown  in Appendix  A Fig. S5. The particle  size of the inocu- \\nlated sludge  below 200 μm accounted  for 74% of the inoculated  \\nsludge.  Compared  with inoculated  sludge,  the proportion  of 0- \\n200 μm sludge  in UASB1,  UASB2  and UASB3  decreased  on day \\n50 and day 149, accounting  for 49.6% ±4.5% in average.  How- \\never, the proportion  of particles  smaller  than 200 μm in UASB1,  \\nUASB2  and UASB3  increased  to 70.6% ±3.2% on day 230. Also, \\nthe proportion  of sludge  greater  than 1000 μm increased  from \\n2.1% in the inoculum  sludge  to over 7.3% in UASB1,  UASB2  \\nand UASB3  on days 50 and 149. However,  on day 230, the pro- \\nportion  of particles  larger than 1000 μm were reduced  to 1.6% \\n(in UASB2)  and 1.7% (in UASB3),  respectively.

In order to study the proper-  ties of SLS that accumulated  in the reactor,  GS and SCGS col- \\nlected from UASB1  on day 315 were investigated  by batch ac- \\ntivity tests using acetate  as the carbon  source  to assess the in- \\nfluence  of SLS on the mechanism  of sulfate  reduction  ( Fig. 4 ). \\nFig. 4 shows that there were no changes  in the acetate  and \\nsulfate  concentrations  in batch tests performed  with GS and \\nSCGS, which further  confirmed  that after 315 days of opera-  \\ntion, acetoclastic  methanogens  and acetotrophic  SRB were not \\npresent  in the UASB reactor.  \\nFig. 5 shows the time course  of sulfate  reduction  with GS \\nand SCGS using propionate  as carbon  source.  GS and SCGS \\nboth reduced  sulfate  to sulfide,  while acetate  and inorganic  \\ncarbon  were produced.  The specific  rates of propionate  con- \\nsumption  and sulfate  reduction  of GS and SCGS are shown  in \\nTable 2 . The propionate  consumption  rate and sulfate  reduc-  \\ntion rate of GS were 68% and 66% higher  than those of SCGS, \\nrespectively.  \\n2.2.2. GS and SLS tests feeding  glycerol  \\nIn order to analyze  the difference  between  GS and SLS and to \\nassess the influence  of SLS on glycerol  fermentation,  sludge  \\nwithdrawn  from UASB6  on day 431 was handled.  Fig. 6 shows \\nthe activity  test using glycerol  as the carbon  source.  GS re- \\nduced sulfate  throughout  the test ( Fig. 6 a). Instead,  SLS re- \\nquired  an adaptation  period as it started  to reduce  sulfate  only \\nafter 24 hr ( Fig. 6 b). Glycerol  was fermented  both by GS and \\nSLS leading  to ethanol,  1,3-propanediol,  formate,  acetate  and \\npropionate  production  in both cases followed  by ethanol,  1,3- \\npropanediol,  formate  and propionate  consumption  accompa-  \\nnied by sulfate  reduction  and coupled  to acetate  and inor- \\nganic carbon  accumulation  throughout  the test. However,  the \\nrates of accumulation  and depletion  of each compound  in the \\ntests with GS and SLS were different.  Essentially,  a much faster \\nfermentation  rate was observed  for SLS with respect  to GS, \\nwhile a faster use of electron  donors  was observed  for GS than \\nfor SLS.

The region from 1200 to 1100 cm −1 shows \\nthe indicative  of C-O-C binding,  typically  as sugars  bonds (Ap- \\npendix  A Fig. S9). The absorbance  at 1150 cm −1 was 0.16 and \\n0.07 for SLS and GS, respectively.  \\nThe same UASB reactor  was operated  under different  sul- \\nfate and organic  loading  rates in previous  works ( Fernández-  \\nPalacios  et al., 2019 ; Fernández-Palacios,  2020 ). After the long- \\nterm operation  varying  COD/S-SO  4 2 −ratios, SLS was also ob- \\nserved.  Results  of FAMEs  analysis  of SLS samples  extracted  \\nfrom that operation  after 490 days are presented  in Appendix  \\nA Table S2. Palmitic  acid was the main LCFAs identified  and \\nquantified  compound  in SLS from samples  collected  at differ- \\nent heights  of the UASB reactor.  Other interesting  compounds  \\nthat were detected  in the samples  but were not quantified  \\nwere methyl  esters and wax esters.  \\n3. Discussion  \\nA progressive  decrease  in methane  production  was accom-  \\npanied  by the decrease  of TOC RE at a TOC/S-SO  4 2 −ra- \\ntio of 1.5 ±0.3 g C/g S when crude glycerol  was fed in \\nthe UASB reactor.  At the same time, VFAs (mainly  acetate,  \\npropionate)  progressively  accumulated  on stage III and IV \\n(Appendix  A Fig. S4). However,  the concentration  of the \\nnon-ionic  forms of VFAs (acetic  acid and propionic  mainly)  \\nwere residual  under the pH of operation  considering  the p K a of acetic and propionic  acids, 4.75 and 4.87, respec-  \\ntively. The microbial  diversity  dynamics  during  the long-term  \\noperation  of the UASB reactor  was studied  by Fernández-  \\nPalacios  et al. (2021) . The relative  abundance  of methanogens,  \\nincluding  Methanosaeta,  Methanobacteria,  Methanomicrobiales  , \\nshowed  a downward  trend. Methanogens  were hardly de- \\ntected after 230 days operation,  which confirmed  the wash- \\nout of methanogens.  In contrast,  a remarkable  increase  in the \\nrelative  abundance  of SRB was observed.  Illumina  sequencing  \\nresults  were consistent  with the results  of methane  produc-  \\ntion and VFAs accumulation,  proving  that methanogenic  GS \\nprogressively  switched  to sulfidogenic  sludge  performing  high \\nsulfate  RE. \\nThe pH and sulfide  concentration  play a major role in the \\ncompetition  between  SRB and methanogens  ( O’Flaherty  et al., \\n1998 ). The growth  rate of methanogens  was higher  than that \\nof SRB at pH < 7.0, and opposite  results  were found at pH > \\n7.5. The pH in the inlet of the UASB reactor  was over 7.5 dur- \\ning this study (Appendix  A Fig. S4). The toxicity  of sulfide  is \\ncaused  by undissociated  sulfide  molecules  that permeate  the \\ncell membrane  ( Kaksonen  and Puhakka,  2007 ). The inhibitory  \\neffect of H 2 S on methanogens  was greater  than that on SRB \\n( Sarti and Zaiat, 2011 ). Methane  production  by methanogenic  \\narchaea  can be limited  also by LCFAs,  specifically  palmitic  acid \\n( Deaver  et al., 2020 ; Silva et al., 2016 ). Palmitic  acid was iden- \\ntified as the main component  among  the LCFAs in the UASB \\nreactor  (Appendix  A Table S2). Palmitic  acid has a toxic effect \\non methanogenic  archaea  ( Silva et al., 2016 ), and the adsorp-  \\ntion of LCFAs onto microbial  biomass  can lead to mass transfer  \\nlimitation  of substrates  ( Pereira  et al., 2005 ), which might be a \\npotential  factor for the inhibition  of methanogenic  activity.  \\nThe overall  glycerol  RE of the UASB reactor  was over 90% \\nwith high sulfate  RE (over 83%) before day 280. However,  \\nboth the overall  glycerol  RE and sulfate  RE started  to de- \\ncline after 280 days of operation.  The decline  of granules  \\nsize was observed  after the cease of methanogenic  activ- \\nity. Wu et al. (2016) found that granule  size positively  corre- \\nlated with biogas production  rate. Acetotrophic  methanogens  \\nplayed  a key role in granulation  ( Hulshoff  Pol et al., 2004 ), \\nand the lack of methane  production  resulted  in poor sludge  \\ngranulation  ( Mora et al., 2020b ). Previous  studies  found that \\ngranules  strength  was reduced  upon sulfidogenic  operation  \\nof anaerobic  reactors  and the diameter  of GS decreased  \\n( Kobayashi  et al., 2015 ; Omil et al., 1997a ), which might ex- ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Weijma  et al. (2000) found the disintegration  \\nof sludge  in an expanded  GS bed reactor  treating  methanol  \\nduring  the period of low biogas production,  and reported  that \\nsludge  particles  were gradually  covered  by fluffy cotton-like  \\nmaterial.  Similarly,  in the present  study, when no biogas was \\nproduced  in the UASB reactor,  decrease  in granule  ´s size was \\nalso observed  followed  by SLS accumulation.  \\nAs it can be seen in SEM images,  the SLS presented  a \\nwhite cotton-like  aspect.  The formation  of SLS may be at- \\ntributed  to the accumulation  of intermediate  metabolites  in \\nextracellular  polymeric  substances,  such as fats, oils, greases,  \\nor polysaccharides  ( Jeganathan  et al., 2006 ; Lu et al., 2015b ). \\nThe formation  of SLS may also be due to the continuous  ac- \\ncumulation  of other organic  carbon  substances  in crude glyc- \\nerol that were not completely  degraded  by GS, thus encir- \\ncling the GS. It has been previously  reported  that crude glyc- \\nerol contains  FAMEs,  free fatty acids, glycerides  and LCFAs \\n( Hu et al., 2012 ; Viana et al., 2012 ). LCFAs can form a layer on \\nthe surface  of biomass  and prevent  the substrate  from enter- \\ning the biomass,  thus leading  to limited  substrate  diffusion  \\ninto the granules  ( Viana et al., 2012 ). In addition,  LCFAs can \\nattach the biomass  and cause its flotation  ( Viana et al., 2012 ). \\nHwu et al. (1998) found that treatment  of LCFAs-containing  \\nwastewater  in an UASB lead to methanogenesis  inhibition  and \\ngranular  sludge  flotation.  LCFAs accumulated  in the UASB re- \\nactor after long-term  operation  under sulfidogenic  conditions  \\nin our work. Sludge  flotation  is a limiting  factor for anaero-  \\nbic treatment  of wastewater  with higher  loading  rates because  \\nthis phenomenon  can lead to a severe biomass  washout  and \\nsystem  performance  deterioration  ( Jeganathan  et al., 2006 ). As \\ncan be observed  in Fig. 2 d, the decrease  in biomass  concentra-  \\ntion is accompanied  by a decrease  in sulfate  RE and sulfate  \\nremoval  capacity,  which indicated  that sludge  flotation  lead \\nto the washout  of biomass  and the drop of the reactor  perfor-  \\nmance.  This may explain  the gradual  decline  of sulfate  RE and \\nglycerol  RE at stage IV of the long-term  UASB operation.  \\nThe evaluation  of UASB reactor  stratification  can help to \\nunderstand  the effect of the sludge  at different  heights  on sul- \\nfate reduction  and degradation  of organic  compounds.  It is ob- \\nserved  that sulfate  reduction  and glycerol  degradation  were \\nmainly  completed  at the bottom  of the UASB reactor,  which \\nwas due to the high biomass  concentration  at this height of \\nthe UASB reactor  (UASB inlet to UASB2).  The biomass  at the \\nbottom  of the sludge  bed (UASB inlet to UASB2)  accounted  \\nfor over 70% of the overall  VSS of the reactor  before 300 days \\nof UASB operation.  The biomass  from UASB inlet to UASB2  \\nalso accounted  for 57% and 78% on day 390 and day 639, re- \\nspectively.  Results  are consistent  with previous  studies,  which \\nfound that the higher  methanogenic  activity  was observed  at \\nthe bottom  of the sludge  bed in an UASB-anaerobic  membrane  \\nbioreactor  treating  municipal  wastewater  because  the con- \\ncentration  of VSS increased  along with the decreasing  height \\nof the sludge  bed ( Mahmoud  et al., 2004 ; Ozgun  et al., 2019 ). \\nSimilarly  to what was observed  by Ozgun  et al. (2019) , the high- \\nest specific  methanogenic  activity  was observed  at the bottom  \\npart of the sludge  bed, as the more active biomass  remained  \\nnear the inlet of the reactor,  while the inactive  biomass  moved  \\ntowards  the top of the sludge  bed or suspended  on the top of \\nthe reactor.  GS, SCGS and SLS were also investigated  by batch activ- \\nity tests to identify  the influence  of SLS on the mechanism  \\nof sulfate  reduction  and glycerol  degradation.  When propi- \\nonate was used as carbon  source  to reduce  sulfate,  SRB con- \\nverted propionate  to acetate  and inorganic  carbon.  The mech- \\nanism of sulfate  reduction  with propionate  observed  herein  \\nis consistent  with previous  studies  ( Liamleam  and Annach-  \\nhatre, 2007 ; Muyzer  and Stams,  2008 ). Since the same prod- \\nucts were observed  in the activity  test performed  with GS and \\nSCGS using propionate  to reduce  sulfate  as shown  in Fig. 5 , \\nit can be concluded  that the SLS presented  the same mecha-  \\nnism of sulfate  reduction.  However,  the specific  sulfate  reduc-  \\ntion rate was higher  in the case of GS than in that of SCGS, \\nindicating  that SLS may affect the mass transfer  of the sub- \\nstrates,  resulting  in a decrease  of the specific  sulfate  reduction  \\nrate. \\nIn the activity  tests performed  with GS and SLS with glyc- \\nerol as the carbon  source  to reduce  sulfate,  both GS and SLS \\nfermented  glycerol  into formate,  acetate,  propionate,  ethanol,  \\n1,3-propanediol  and inorganic  carbon.  In addition,  the inter- \\nmediate  products  of glycerol  were consumed  with sulfate  re- \\nduction  observed.  This indicates  that SLS is also capable  of fer- \\nmenting  glycerol  and reducing  sulfate.  When comparing  the \\nspecific  rates of glycerol  fermentation  between  GS and SLS, \\nSLS was more efficient  in degrading  glycerol  than GS. The spe- \\ncific substrate  utilization  activity  of GS and flocculant  sludge  \\nwas compared  in UASB reactors  processing  wastewater  from \\nfood industries  ( Oleszkiewicz  and Romanek,  1989 ). They found \\nthat the flocculant  sludge  formed  during  the operation  of an \\nUASB reactor  had a higher  specific  activity  for the degrada-  \\ntion of complex  polymers  than the GS in anaerobic  processes,  \\nwhich is similar  to the results  found herein.  \\nFig. 6 a and b show that sulfate  reduction  was not related  \\nto glycerol  fermentation.  Sulfate  was reduced  accompanied  \\nby the degradation  intermediate  products  of glycerol  degra- \\ndation.  This confirmed  that the carbon  sources  used for sul- \\nfate reduction  were formate,  ethanol  and 1,3-propanediol,  \\nin which the mechanism  of sulfate  reduction  using glycerol  \\nas the carbon  source  is consistent  with our previous  work \\n( Zhou et al., 2022 ). When comparing  the specific  rates of sul- \\nfate reduction  between  GS and SLS, SLS was found to be less \\nefficient  in reducing  sulfate  than GS. In addition,  as can be \\nseen in Fig. 6 d, even if there was sufficient  carbon  source  (for- \\nmate, ethanol  and 1,3-propanediol)  to reduce  sulfate,  SLS still \\nneeded  time to adapt and perform  the sulfate  reduction  pro- \\ncess, which may be caused  by mass transfer  limitation  of sul- \\nfate. Compared  with GS in the UASB reactor,  GS covered  by \\nSLS may cause sulfate  to be discharged  from the UASB reac- \\ntor before entering  the cell due to mass transfer  limitation,  \\nwhich may lead to a decrease  in the sulfate  reduction  effi- \\nciency.  Therefore,  a significant  reason  for the reduced  sulfate  \\nRE in the UASB reactor  may also be that the SLS limited  the \\nmass transfer  of sulfate,  in addition  to biomass  washout  from \\nthe UASB reactor.  \\nThe difference  of specific  rates between  GS and SLS were \\nalso caused  by the bacteria  community  differences.  A wide \\nrange of microorganisms  have been observed  to ferment  glyc- \\nerol, including  Dysgonomonas  ( Moscoviz  et al., 2018 ), Klebsiella  \\n( Cheng et al., 2007 ), Propionibacterium  ( Himmi  et al., 2000 ) and \\nPropionispora  ( Abou-Zeid  et al., 2004 ) .

Helicobacter  is con- \\nsidered  to be a microaerophile  capable  of oxidizing  a variety  of \\norganic  acids, such as formate,  lactate,  succinate  and pyruvate  \\n( Joubert  and Britz, 1987 ). In this work, the relative  abundances  \\nof fermentative  microorganisms  in GS (33.0%)  were lower than \\nthat in SLS (54.6%),  which agrees with the lower glycerol  fer- \\nmentation  rate in GS and higher  fermentation  rate in SLS. \\nDesulfovibrio  is a genus of SRB reported  to oxidize  organic  \\ncarbon  compounds  (including  lactate,  ethanol,  malate,  pyru- \\nvate, succinate)  to acetate  for sulfate  reduction  ( Odom and \\nPeck, 1981 ; Qatibi et al., 1991 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). Desulfobulbus  \\ngenus can oxidize  pyruvate,  propionate  and ethanol  to ac- \\netate ( Bak and Pfennig,  1991 ; Bertolino  et al., 2012 ; Muyzer  and \\nStams,  2008 ; Zeng et al., 2019 ). The main sulfate-reducer  gen- \\nera found herein  were Desulfobulbus  and Desulfovibrio  , both re- \\nported  as incomplete  oxidizing  SRB, which explains  the ac- \\ncumulation  of acetate  in the batch activity  tests. Compared  \\nto SLS, higher  relative  abundances  of Desulfobulbus  and Desul- \\nfovibrio  in GS agree with the higher  sulfate  reduction  rate \\nfound in GS, meaning  that the populations  of SRB were prob- \\nably mainly  growing  in the core of the granules,  what can also \\nexplain  the decrease  of sulfate  RE when granules  turned  into \\nslime-covered  granules.  \\nBatch activity  tests and 16s rRNA gene analysis  of the mi- \\ncrobial  communities  revealed  that GS played  a more impor-  \\ntant role in sulfate  reduction  than SLS since GS contained  \\nmore sulfate  reducers  (mainly  Desulfobulbus  and Desulfovibrio  ). \\nIn terms of fermentation,  glycerol  fermentation  was not af- \\nfected by SLS. Conversely,  the fermentation  rate of glycerol  \\nin SLS was higher  than that of GS. The analysis  of microbial  \\ndiversity  revealed  that high relative  abundances  of fermen-  \\ntative microorganisms  was identified  in SLS. This shows that \\nthe reason  for the decrease  of the glycerol  RE in UASB reactor  \\nwas not related  to the degradation  mechanism  of glycerol  by \\nthe SLS, but because  the SLS triggered  the washout  of biomass  \\nfrom the UASB reactor.  \\nFTIR spectra  showed  no significant  differences  between  GS \\nand SLS samples.  The biggest  difference  of peaks between  \\nGS and SLS was around  at 1635 and 1030 cm −1 . The ratio \\nbetween  the absorbance  at 1635 cm −1 over the absorbance  \\nat 1030 cm −1 shows the relatively  quantity  of protein.  The \\nratio was 1.1 for SLS and 0.8 for GS, which indicates  that \\nSLS contained  relatively  more proteins  than GS. Proteins  are \\nfundamental  components  of biomolecules.  The soluble  pro- \\ntein content  generally  increases  after exposure  to pollutants.  \\nIn order to reduce  toxic effects,  microbes  can be induced  \\nto synthesize  defensive  proteins  under the stress of haz- \\nardous  substances  ( Imlay, 2008 ; Sabatini  et al., 2009 ). Specif-  \\nically, Li et al. (2022) showed  that excessive  extracellular  poly- \\nmeric substances  (EPS) production,  especially  the protein-  \\nlike substances,  was an effective  strategy  for reducing  certain  \\nnanoparticles  toxicity  in anaerobic  granular  sludge.  Since SLS covered  GS, SLS first contacted  LCFAs and sulfide  during  glyc- \\nerol fermentation  and sulfate  reduction.  Thus, compared  to \\nGS, SLS had higher  exposure  to sulfide  and LCFAs,  which may \\nexplain  higher  protein  contents  in SLS. \\nOverall,  different  methods  (SEM, FAMEs,  Illumina  sequenc-  \\ning and FT-IR) used for SLS analysis  showed  that SLS was the \\nmixture  of biomass  and organic/inorganic  compounds  com- \\ning from the impurities  contained  in crude glycerol  and the \\nformation  of other intermediate  products.  With all the in- \\nformation  acquired,  the formation  of SLS was attributed  to \\na combination  of factors  along the long-term  operation,  in- \\ncluding  sulfide  production,  the cease of methanogenic  activity,  \\nwashout  of methanogens,  static sludge  bed, impurities  com- \\npounds  contained  in crude glycerol  and the formation  of other \\nintermediates.  \\nAs a by-product  of the biodiesel  industry,  there are clear ad- \\nvantages  in the use of crude glycerol  as electron  donor such as \\nits large COD content,  its availability  and low cost among  oth- \\ners. However,  the presence  of impurities  may hinder  its appli- \\ncation unless  alternatives  to face long-term  operation  issues \\nare found.  Oleszkiewicz  and Romanek  (1989) reported  that the \\naddition  of calcium  and phosphate  promoted  sticky, floccu-  \\nlant sludge  formation,  while granular  biomass  was formed  in \\nthe treatment  of wastewater  supplemented  with ferric ions \\nand traces of nickel and cobalt.  The use of traces of metallic  \\nelements  can promote  granulation  and avoid sludge  disinte-  \\ngration  and washout  of biomass.  Increasing  the shear force in \\nthe reactor  could be another  strategy  for preventing  granules  \\nflotation  ( Chen et al., 2014 ) and crude glycerol  by-products  ac- \\ncumulation.  The increase  of shearing  forces can be achieved  \\nby adding  an internal  recirculation  pump to increase  the up- \\nflow velocity  as well as the use of intermittent  pulses of nitro- \\ngen from the bottom  of the reactor  to also avoid bed packing.  \\nHowever,  further  research  is needed  in order to assess the vi- \\nability of such alternatives.  Despite  the fact that the perfor-  \\nmance  deterioration  was mainly  attributed  to the washout  \\nof biomass  due to SLS accumulation  and consequent  sludge  \\nflotation,  still other factors  not considered  in the present  work \\nsuch as the change  of the metabolic  functions  of the micro-  \\nbial cultures  linked to the SLS accumulation  should  be inves- \\ntigated.  \\n4. Conclusions  \\nThe lack of biogas production  in a sulfate-reducing  UASB lead \\nto a reduction  in the particle  size of granular  biomass  and to \\nthe accumulation  of a SLS due to the presence  of organic  com- \\npounds  and other impurities  present  in crude glycerol.  SLS ac- \\ncumulation  also led to sludge  flotation,  which resulted  in an \\nincreased  washout  of sludge.  Subsequently,  the sulfate  RE and \\nglycerol  RE in the reactor  decreased,  and the system  perfor-  \\nmance  deteriorated.  Sulfate  removal  capacity  and glycerol  re- \\nmoval capacity  at different  heights  of the UASB reactor  corre- \\nlated well with the sludge  concentration.  In the sulfate  reduc-  \\ntion processes  with propionate  and glycerol  as carbon  sources  \\nin batch tests, results  confirmed  that SLS did not change  the \\nmechanism  of sulfate  reduction  and glycerol  degradation  but \\ndecreased  the rate of sulfate  reduction.

To address \\nthis gap, we perform a systematic review and two quantitative analyses. First, we analyze results \\nfrom 39 studies, obtained through the PRISMA method. Less than 50% of the studies that show up as \\nresults for the term “bilingual disadvantage” report exclusively a disadvantage, that shows bilinguals \\nperforming worse than monolinguals in a task. A Bayesian analysis reveals robust evidence for \\nbilingual effects, but no evidence for differences in the proportion of advantages and disadvantages, \\nsuggesting that when results from different cognitive domains such as executive functions and \\nverbal fluency are analyzed together, bilingual effects amount to a zero-sum game. This finding was \\nreplicated by repeating the analysis, using the datasets of two recent meta-analyses. We propose that \\nthe equilibrium we observe between positive and negative outcomes may not be accidental. Contrary \\nto widespread belief, advantageous and disadvantageous effects are not stand-alone outcomes in free \\nvariation. We reframe them as the connatural components of a dynamic trade-off, whereby enhanced \\nperformance in one cognitive measure is offset by an incurred cost in another domain.\\nOne of the most heatedly debated topics in psycholinguistics concerns the effects of bilingualism on cognition. \\nMany studies have linked bilingualism to an enhanced performance in tasks that tap into a range of executive \\nfunction  measures1–3. Although knowing multiple languages facilitates communication as well as exposure to a \\nvariety of cultures and is thus always an  advantage4, the term “bilingual advantage” has a narrower meaning. It \\nwas introduced to refer specifically to results that show that bilinguals may perform better than monolinguals in \\ncertain cognitive tasks, mostly pertaining to conflict  resolution2,3,5. In parallel to the line of literature that pro -\\nduced results showing that bilinguals demonstrate a superior performance in certain tasks, another line started \\nadducing results that revealed a bilingual disadvantage, mainly in the domain of semantic fluency and  naming6,7.\\nAs the original finding of a bilingual advantage in executive functioning was put to test in an ever-expanding \\nrange of child and adult, neurotypical and neuroatypical populations, conflicting results started emerging, even \\nwhen using the exact same tasks. Some studies found a robust bilingual advantage in executive  functioning3, while \\nothers failed to find evidence for its existence, obtaining results that suggested that the effect is indistinguishable \\nfrom  zero8,9. This inconsistent occurrence of the bilingual advantage gave rise to concerns about its status as a \\nrobust  phenomenon10,11. While several explanations have been offered for both sets of  results12–16, the degree to \\nwhich bilingual advantages and disadvantages co-occur is still unknown. This is an important knowledge gap, \\ngiven that the field of bilingualism research has been repeatedly linked to meta-analyses that reveal publication \\nbias against negative  results17,18. Some studies have even claimed that the entire idea of a bilingual advantage \\nmay have stemmed from this publication  bias17. Since some of the effects that attest to publication bias did not \\n replicate19,20, a clearer understanding of the prevalence of bilingual advantages and disadvantages is missing.\\nImportantly, the problem runs deeper than not knowing the degree of co-occurrence of advantages and dis-\\nadvantages in bilingual cognition, because most studies describe either  advantages or  disadvantages, as if they \\nwere stand-alone effects. What is consistently left in the margins is the appreciation of the fact that enhancing \\none aspect of a system (e.g., any goal-directed system, including cognition) entails a cost for another aspect of \\nthe same  system21. Succinctly put, enhanced computational performance never comes for  free21.

This means that if a(n) (dis)advantageous effect is found, it likely forms part \\nof a trade-off, because enhanced performance in one domain is bound to be compensated in another domain. In \\nbiology, the notion of the trade-off refers to a negative correlation between processes that make use of the same \\nfinite resources within an  organism22. From an evolutionary point of view, such trade-offs are frequent across \\nspecies and emerge because one trait cannot be optimized without creating an expense for other traits, given \\nthat organisms function together as integrated wholes  in the Darwinian  sense23. From a developmental point of \\nview, trade-offs often translate into a negative relationship between traits, based on morphological, physiological, \\nand environmental characteristics that contribute to the development of an organism (e.g., a speed vs. stamina \\ntrade-off in Olympic sprinters vs.  marathoners24).\\nAlthough a few studies have mentioned the possibility that specific advantages and disadvantages share \\norigin (e.g., Luo et\\xa0al.25 ask whether it is possible that a common mechanism underlies the opposite effects that \\nthey found for letter and category fluency in bilinguals), only a handful of them have approached the effects of \\nbilingualism on cognition through explicitly proposing a trade-off that links them together. Struys et\\xa0al.26 present \\nevidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off in executive functioning, with the effect being specific to the bilingual \\npopulations they tested. More specifically, they report null results in terms of a bilingual advantage and clear-cut \\nresults for speed-accuracy trade-offs in bilinguals, but not in monolinguals: bilinguals either boost their response \\ntimes sacrificing accuracy or they prioritize accuracy, slowing down their  performance26,27. Marsh et\\xa0al.28 observe \\nthat decreased semantic fluency in bilinguals can be explained as an offset against enhanced executive functions \\nor metalinguistic awareness. Last, Leivada et\\xa0al.29 find evidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off in the grammatical \\ndomain. Testing the fallibility of monolinguals and bilinguals in grammatical illusions (i.e., sentences that appear \\nmeaningful and well-formed, but are not), bilinguals were found to be better than monolinguals in detecting \\nthe grammatical anomalies in the seemingly well-formed sentences, but they were also slower in providing an \\nanswer. Leivada et\\xa0al.29 frame this finding through proposing the Plurilingual Adaptive Trade-off Hypothesis, \\naccording to which, the bilinguals’ adaptive alteration of their language control  abilities30 may result in enhanced \\n(pragmatic) monitoring, but this advantage is part of a larger bundle of effects that are not all advantageous.\\nThe trade-off approach carries important implications for the findings of many (meta-)analyses, and espe-\\ncially for the ones that report both a null finding and a negative finding (i.e., bilingual disadvantage), or group \\ntogether the two, eventually juxtaposing this “negative/null” category to the category of positive findings (i.e., \\nbilingual advantage). For example, de Bruin et\\xa0al.17 examine whether the publication of conference abstracts \\nis affected by the stance they take in the bilingual-advantage debate. They find evidence for a publication bias: \\nstudies that report a disadvantage are the least likely to be published, while studies supporting the bilingual-\\nadvantage hypothesis are the most likely to be published. The classification system they employ consists of 4 \\nmutually exclusive categories: (i) positive result (i.e., evidence in favor of a bilingual advantage), (ii) mixed result, \\npredominantly positive (i.e., evidence in favor of a bilingual advantage, albeit not in all tasks or populations), \\n(iii) mixed result, predominantly negative (i.e., partial/inconsistent evidence in favor of a bilingual advantage, \\nbut failure to find it in conditions where it was expected), and (iv) negative or null result (i.e., evidence in favor \\nof a bilingual disadvantage or absence of significant differences between monolinguals and bilinguals). The last \\ncategory groups together two very different outcomes: an effect that has been argued to exist and an effect that \\nhas been argued to be indistinguishable from zero. However, under the perspective we have laid out so far, find -\\ning a bilingual disadvantage is potentially interpreted as indirect evidence for a bilingual advantage in another \\ndomain. Consequently, treating a negative result as synonymous to a null result, and putting them together in \\none category, does not do justice to the correlation between advantages and  disadvantages20.\\nTo give a second example of how bringing trade-offs into the picture is informative in relation to interpret -\\ning the conclusions of meta-analyses, Lehtonen et\\xa0al.18 argue that their analysis of 152 studies does not provide \\nsystematic support for the view that bilingualism grants an advantage in cognitive control functions in adults. \\nMoreover, they report finding evidence for a small bilingual disadvantage in verbal fluency tasks. Y et if advan-\\ntages and disadvantages are viewed as two sides of the same coin, finding a disadvantage probably entails the \\npresence of an advantage (unless of course one explains why bilingualism would behave in a way that challenges \\ncurrent knowledge about the workings of human  cognition21, by virtue of causing enhancements that are not \\ncompensated for). If enhanced computational performance indeed does not come for free, observing a cost in \\nthe form of a disadvantage inevitably raises the question of what enhancement this disadvantage is compensat -\\ning for. From this perspective, Lehtonen et\\xa0al.18 provide direct evidence for a bilingual disadvantage and indirect \\nevidence for a bilingual advantage. This reframing of their results seems to be at odds with their conclusion that \\nbilingualism is not reliably  associated with cognitive benefits.\\nAlthough it remains an open question whether such advantages should be attributed to monitoring two \\nlanguage systems, and by extension to bilingualism per se, as opposed to the interaction of bilingualism with \\nother factors (e.g., socio-economic status, cultural  background9,31,32, our focus is not on the much-discussed, yet \\nstill unclear, origin of the observed effects  (see33 for a discussion of open questions in that domain), but on their \\nsignificantly understudied distribution. In a nutshell, the purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which \\nadvantageous and disadvantageous effects complement each other across different child and adult, neurotypical \\nand neuroatypical populations. Subsequently, we discuss the nature of the cognitive trade-offs, specifically as they \\nemerge in the context of bilingualism research and present their main characteristics in terms of development \\n(i.e., how they come to exist in the individual) and plasticity (i.e., how they evolve over time in the individual).', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In the second phase, 18 complementary studies were selected and examined (following the process \\ndescribed below) with the aim to synthesize the overall characteristics of the populations identified in the \\nfirst phase in terms of global advantages and disadvantages.\\n(v) Disadvantage: Studies that report a disadvantage for a population/language group for which no advantage \\nhas been found in the literature.\\nIn the Supplementary Information file, Supplementary Table\\xa01 presents a summary of the results, and Supple-\\nmentary Table\\xa02 presents the demographics of our sample, split in three age groups, together with their distribu-\\ntion in terms of results. The pool of data, the complete list of studies that were analyzed for this review, and an \\nindividual analysis of each study are available at https://  osf. io/ 8w6ux/.\\nEncompassing a variety of tasks and populations, our pool of data suggests that about 30% of the screened \\nstudies either report both an advantage and a disadvantage [category (i)] or only an advantage [category (iii)]. \\nExcluding category (ii), which reports no bilingual effects and amounts to about 30% of the results, the remain -\\ning 40% [n = 16, category (iv)] of studies report only a bilingual disadvantage.\\nIn the second phase, we performed a targeted search of the literature to determine to what extent bilingual \\ndisadvantages and advantages co-occur across populations. The bilingual groups in this complementary pool \\nof data were individually matched to the “disadvantage-only” studies in the PRISMA-obtained pool of data for \\nage, type of bilingualism, and linguistic profile. This additional database covers results from 26 experiments and \\n3,448 participants. We determined that all the populations for which only disadvantages have been found in the \\nfirst pool of data have been linked to bilingual advantages in other studies. The full list of complementary studies, \\nmatched to the studies obtained through the PRISMA protocol, is given and discussed at https://  osf. io/ 8w6ux/.\\nOne important note is due to the compilation of the list of complementary studies. To bring them together, \\nwe performed an extensive literature review (without using the PRISMA protocol as each search was tailored to \\none study in the original pool of data), and we identified those studies that come closest to the original study in \\nterms of as many of the following characteristics as possible: the languages used (spoken or signed), the tested age \\ngroups, and the overall linguistic profile. However, as in all meta-analyses, the obtained comparisons are at best \\napproximate. We cannot provide a perfect or close-to-perfect match across all variables, because such a degree of \\nmatching is not possible for many of the tested populations. This point relates to the visibility of certain groups \\nin bilingualism research: the level of approximation is solid when one compares studies which target popula-\\ntions that have been thoroughly tested (e.g., bilingual college students of English and Spanish in the US), but \\nless solid when one has very few studies from which a close match can be drawn, because the target populations \\nuse severely understudied minority, non-standard, or non-official languages. In terms of our methods, faced \\nwith the choice of favoring either solid matching (by including only those studies that deal with populations that \\nhave a high visibility and can afford the firmest comparisons) or inclusion (by including those studies that can \\nonly partially be matched for a subset of their characteristics), we chose the latter. However, we highlight again \\nthe caveat of comparability: there is no perfect match between the groups and all comparisons operate on some \\nlevel of approximation that is heavily influenced by the overall visibility and representation of certain groups.\\nTurning to the quantitative analysis of the present study, this differs from previous meta-analyses on the topic \\nin many critical respects. First, it does not focus exclusively on effects found in the domain of executive functions. \\nIf one examines the recent meta-analyses of bilingual adaptations, it is likely that one will obtain an incomplete \\npicture, because these analyses involve samples that represent only the domain of executive  control12,18,19,35,36. \\nHowever, bilingualism may have an impact on a variety of cognitive measures (e.g., syntactic processing, meta-\\nlinguistic awareness, word learning). There is no reason for confining our analyses to results that come from \\none cognitive domain, when there is ample evidence for bilingual adaptations across domains. To remedy this \\nbias in the representation of bilingual adaptations and provide a more complete picture, no cognitive domain \\nwas excluded from our pool of data. Second, the process of outlier removal in meta-analyses may contribute to \\nmasking group differences between monolinguals and  bilinguals19, leading to a null effect. To bypass this chal -\\nlenge, the present study will use an alternative quantitative approach, following  Grundy19. Last, unlike previ-\\nous meta-analyses and quantitative analyses on the topic, this analysis does not take bilingual advantages and \\ndisadvantages as unique outcomes within a study. In other words, if a study finds evidence for both advantages \\nand disadvantages, both results are represented in our analysis.\\nOur quantitative analysis has two aims. The first aim is to determine whether studies in our pool of data are \\nmore likely to favor a null outcome or find evidence for bilingual effects. To measure this, we adapt the quantita -\\ntive approach of  Grundy19 in terms of coding, while using the same statistical analyses: Studies were coded as 1 \\nif they found evidence for a bilingual advantage or disadvantage, and as -1 if no group differences were reported. \\nIf a study found both types of effects (e.g., a bilingual advantage in reaction times and a bilingual disadvantage \\nin accuracy), this was coded as two entries, one for each effect.\\nThe second aim is to zoom into the studies that find evidence for bilingual effects in order to determine \\nthe overall proportion of bilingual advantages and disadvantages.

If a study \\nfound evidence for both effects, two entries were created for this study, following the previously described process.\\nCritics of the bilingual-advantage hypothesis have proposed that a Bayesian approach is more appropriate \\nwhen one seeks to examine the effects of bilingualism on executive  functions37. Although the present quantitative \\nanalysis does not focus exclusively on executive functions, we concur about the importance of running analyses \\nthat are informative about how likely the data are to occur under the null vs. the alternative hypothesis. For this \\nreason, Bayesian analyses are reported. The analyses were run using jamovi, version 2.238. Table\\xa0 1 represents the \\ninput, which corresponds to the studies obtained through the PRISMA protocol (Fig.\\xa0 1). Assessing for possible \\nsample biases, 5 studies from the pool of data were excluded from the quantitative analysis because they involved \\nvery small sample sizes (< 30), which have been argued to provide a blurry picture in bilingualism  research39, \\ncarrying the risk of a substantial increase of the rate of Type I  errors10.\\nResults\\nPRISMA-obtained pool of data: overall effects\\nThe first analysis concerns the overall effects: Do studies in our pool of data provide evidence for bilingual adapta-\\ntions? 34 studies were included in this analysis (Table\\xa0 1). A Bayesian one-sample t-test suggests that the answer is \\npositive,  BF10 = 44.998. Details about the interpretation of the Bayes factor (BF) are given in the Supplementary \\nInformation. As Fig.\\xa0 2 shows, the evidence in favor of interpreting the data as more likely under the alternative \\nhypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that studies in our pool of data are more likely to find evidence for bilingual \\neffects than null effects) is very strong. In the panel “Effect” , we see the overall pattern across studies reporting \\na bilingual effect (1) or not (−\\xa01). The circle represents the mean across studies and the error bars represent \\nstandard error. In the panel “Prior and Posterior” , the prior shows the starting probability before introducing the \\ndata, and the posterior represents the “updated” probability, after the data has been factored in. The panel “Bayes \\nFactor Robustness Check” shows how the BF would change if different priors had been chosen. In our case, the \\nBF is stable across various prior specifications, indicating the robustness of our findings. The sequential analysis \\nrepresents the progression of the BF as each new study enters the analysis. This panel shows that the obtained \\nevidence is very strongly in favor of the alternative hypothesis, which supports the existence of bilingual effects \\n(taking positive and negative outcomes together) as opposed to null outcomes.\\nPRISMA-obtained pool of data: type of effects\\nThe first step of our quantitative analysis has provided evidence for bilingual adaptations. The second step is to \\ndetermine whether one type of effects, advantages or disadvantages, is more frequently attested, by looking into \\nthe overall proportion of bilingual advantages and disadvantages. The literature suggests that publication biases \\naffect the publication of negative  results17,18. The prediction, based on the assumption that the category of bilin-\\ngual advantages is far more plentiful than that of bilingual disadvantages, is that this analysis will reveal that the \\ndata are more probable under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., that one effect is more frequently attested than the \\nother). Repeating the previous analysis while focusing only on the studies in Table\\xa0 1 that find bilingual effects \\n(n = 26), a Bayesian one-sample t-test suggests that there is no evidence that one hypothesis is more strongly \\nsupported than the other,  BF10 = 0.692. BFs between 0.33 and 3 are considered as anecdotal or inconclusive, not \\noffering robust evidence for either  hypothesis40. Since the data are equally likely under either the null or the \\nalternative hypothesis, we cannot conclusively say that either advantages or disadvantages are more prevalent \\nin our pool of data. Figure\\xa0 3 shows the distribution of the results, marking the evidence for the null hypothesis \\nas anecdotal.\\nNotice that in this analysis we have only included studies that find evidence for bilingual effects, excluding \\nthose that find a null result. The reason is conceptual: If a study fails to find evidence for bilingual adaptations, it \\ncannot be determined whether this happens because no real-world effects existed in the first place or because the \\nemployed tasks, testing conditions, or analyses were not sensitive enough to pick up on the effects. Consequently, \\nit is possible that studies with a null outcome affect our sample, by virtue of being included in the analyses as \\npotential hosts of bilingual adaptations, when their status as such cannot be conclusively determined. However, \\nto provide the full picture, we reran the previous analysis including the studies that find a null outcome (n  = 8). \\nWe follow  Grundy19 in coding null outcomes with 0, advantages with 1, and disadvantages with −\\xa01. Again, the \\nresults of a Bayesian one-sample t-test provide only anecdotal evidence for the null  (BF10 = 0.602).\\nAs  Grundy19 notes, one of the main concerns about vote-counting analyses like the one we employed is that \\nthe data may not be weighted fairly if sample size is not considered. The issue of sample and effect sizes is par -\\nticularly relevant in the literature that discusses bilingual  adaptations10,37. To alleviate such concerns, we followed \\nthe weighting procedure of  Grundy19: A sample size correction was applied to the data (the n = 39 studies origi-\\nnally obtained through the PRISMA method) before re-running the analyses. Each study was assigned a weight \\nby dividing the study’s sample size by the total sample size of all studies in our pool of data. This proportional \\nweight was then multiplied by the effect score (i.e., −\\xa01 for a bilingual disadvantage, 1 for a bilingual advantage) \\nto yield a weighted score. Using this approach, a Bayesian one-sample t-test showed moderate evidence in favor \\nof interpreting the data as more probable under the null hypothesis (i.e., equal overall proportion of bilingual \\nadvantages and disadvantages),  BF10 = 0.222. Figure\\xa0 4 shows the distribution of the weighted performance.\\nL&D pool of data: analyses replication\\nOne caveat of our quantitative analysis is that we cannot discard the possibility that our search terms, which \\nfocused on bilingual disadvantages, may have biased our main findings.

Consequently, this result could possibly not be sustained if we analyzed a different pool of data, \\nwhich uses different search terms and inclusion criteria. To address this caveat, we replicate the main finding by \\nrerunning the previous analyses using a second pool of data. This second pool of data contains the datasets of \\ntwo recent meta-analyses: Lehtonen et\\xa0al.18 and Donnelly et\\xa0al.36. The former used the search terms “bilingual” \\nand “monolingual” and terms referring to various domains of cognitive control and executive functioning. The \\nlatter was based on searches that involved a combination of “bilingual” or “bilingualism” with “executive control” , \\n“executive function” , “inhibition” , or “interference control” . Together the two datasets provide a second pool of \\ndata (henceforth, the L&D pool of data) that consists of 186 studies which were analyzed also in  Grundy19 and \\nare here taken as starting point. For our analyses, 7 studies were removed to avoid double representation, as they \\nwere already included in our original pool of data. 12 studies were removed because the full text was not avail -\\nable. 5 studies were removed because they were not in English. 3 studies were removed as they did not report \\nbilingual/monolingual comparisons. 1 study was removed as it did not report the number of participants. 53 \\nstudies were removed for having very small bilingual samples (6–29 participants; cf.10,39 on the consequences of \\nsmall sample biases). Τhe remaining studies (n = 105) were coded and analyzed following the same procedure \\npresented above for the first pool of data. Table\\xa0 2 represents the input, which corresponds to the studies that \\nform the L&D pool of data.\\nThe first analysis addresses the question of whether the L&D pool of data provides robust evidence for bilin-\\ngual adaptations (advantages/disadvantages vs. null). A Bayesian one-sample t-test suggests that the answer is \\npositive,  BF10 = 2.546e+26. Figure\\xa0 5 shows that the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis is classified as \\nextreme, replicating the result we obtained based on our first pool of data.\\nThe second analysis concerns the occurrence of the advantages and disadvantages in the L&D pool of data. \\nFocusing on the studies of Table\\xa0 2 that find evidence for such effects (n = 93), a Bayesian one-sample t-test \\nsuggests that there is no evidence that the data are more probable under the null hypothesis vs. the alternative, \\n BF10 = 1.218 (Fig.\\xa0 6). This result differs from that of  Grundy19, but the difference is explained by the fact that, \\nunlike Grundy, we included in the L&D pool of data verbal processing tasks, and trimmed studies that involved \\nvery small sample sizes (< 30). Recall that BFs between 0.33 and 3 are considered as anecdotal or inconclusive, \\nnot offering robust evidence for either  hypothesis40. In other words, we obtain the same result that we got in the \\nFigure\\xa02.

Again, \\nadding in this analysis the studies that find a null result (n = 12) does not alter this outcome,  BF10 = 1.141. To \\naddress the issue of effect sizes, in the analysis of the first pool of data we followed the weighting procedure of \\n Grundy19: Each study was assigned a weight by dividing the study’s sample size by the total sample size of all \\nstudies, and this proportional weight was multiplied by the effect score (i.e., −\\xa01 for a bilingual disadvantage, 1 \\nfor a bilingual advantage) to yield a weighted score. Applying this approach in the L&D pool of data, a Bayesian \\none-sample t-test showed moderate evidence in favor of the data being more likely under the null hypothesis \\n(i.e., that neither effect is more prevalent than the other),  BF10 = 0.256, confirming the result that we got based \\non the first pool of data.\\nDiscussion\\nThis systematic review and the two quantitative analyses investigate a question that so far lacks a clear answer: \\nTo what extent do bilingual advantages co-occur with bilingual disadvantages? Through analyzing the results of \\n39 studies, obtained through the PRISMA protocol, we determined the co-occurrence of positive and negative \\noutcomes across tasks and populations. Our key finding is that, null results aside, 100% of the populations that \\nare featured in our pool of data can be linked to both advantages and disadvantages. Specifically, in relation to \\nthe studies that reported only a disadvantage, we found at least one other study that presented a counterbalanc-\\ning advantage for the same population/language group, although the caveat of comparability exists, and in some \\ncases, we were not able to obtain a perfect match. Our two quantitative analyses, which are methodologically \\nnovel in representing all outcomes within a study, suggest that there is ample evidence for bilingual adaptations \\nin two different pools of data (one obtained through the PRISMA method and one consisting of the datasets of \\ntwo recent meta-analyses18,36), but no evidence that the data is more likely under the alternative hypothesis that \\nassumes a difference in the prevalence of advantages vs. disadvantages.

Contrary to what seems to be the tacit assumption in the \\nrelevant literature, and even explicitly argued in some of the studies we analyzed (cf. the claim  in28 on how the \\nidea that whatever mechanism causes a bilingual disadvantage may also be responsible for a bilingual advantage \\nseems counterintuitive), we argue that bilingual advantages and disadvantages need not be conceived as stand-\\nalone outcomes in free variation. Instead, they could be viewed as correlations that occur simultaneously in \\nresponse to some environmental trigger that causes an adaptive alteration to the system. In this sense, the effects \\nof bilingualism on cognition would not induce advantages or disadvantages per se, but trade-offs that come in \\ndifferent forms (e.g., speed-accuracy, accuracy-flexibility, efficiency-resistance to noise).\\nAssuming the existence of a cognitive trade-off means that enhancements of a function, when observed, \\ncapitalize on resources that are used across cognitive domains, such that some aspects of performance, efficiency, \\nrobustness, or flexibility must eventually be  taxed21. One well-established cognitive trade-off, for instance, is the \\nspeed-accuracy one for which, succinctly put, faster performance taxes responses’  accuracy41. This trade-off  \\nhypothesis can be conceived as consisting of different ramifications that respond to an environmental trigger \\n(in this case, bilingualism) through playing a zero-sum game42: Once we zoom out of individual studies and \\nobserve the overall picture in a given population, positive and negative effects (i.e., bilingual advantages and \\ndisadvantages) will likely be found to complement each other, striking a balance that optimizes the use of the \\norganism’s finite resources. Such trade-offs are inherent to cognition and life in  general21, and there is ample \\nevidence of applications of the trade-off hypothesis in different branches of neurocognition or evolutionary \\n ecology42. Generally, trade-offs boil down to key, high-level properties of goal-directed systems (e.g., general or \\ntask-specific aspects of performance, resilience, efficiency, robustness, and flexibility). However, we still do not \\nknow what kind of trade-offs bilingualism confers and what the picture of bilingual adaptations would look like \\nwhen systematically analyzed in terms of trade-offs. While certain general patterns can be discerned (e.g., the \\ntrade-off between enhanced cognitive control measures such as switching and hampered verbal fluency), the \\nfield lacks concrete answers as to what makes these two domains good candidates to pair together in a trade-off. \\nFigure\\xa06.

Instead, it requires the linking  of the two under a shared origin. Most \\nstudies in our pool of data do not link the two fronts, even when they adduce evidence for both advantages and \\ndisadvantages. Perhaps the most explicit exception is found  in43  and44, who argue in favor of a compensatory \\neffect, according to which a bilingual language-processing disadvantage may be offset by enhanced language-\\nindependent, sensory processes. At the same time, while the presence of both effects might be acknowledged in \\nsome studies, the general purpose of a study may grant a more prominent position to one of the two outcomes. \\nConsequently, although many studies in our pool of data have reported both advantages and disadvantages, the \\noverall tendency is for such results to be presented as stand-alone effects. For example, it has been suggested that \\nthe acquisition of complex grammatical phenomena is delayed in bilingual  children45. In children with Specific \\nLanguage Impairment (SLI), bilingualism has been argued to confer an additional  disadvantage46. Following a \\ntrade-off approach, however, reduced speed in acquisition is expected to be compensated for in another domain. \\nIndeed, our results suggest that this might be the case. Bilingual children may need more time to acquire cer -\\ntain grammatical phenomena, but they also demonstrate better L3 learning  abilities47, an enhanced capacity to \\nignore irrelevant  information48 and, for children with SLI, better narrative  competence49, which may translate \\ninto overall enhanced flexibility on their part.\\nOur results show that bilingualism, as an environmental trigger, may confer an array of (dis)advantages that \\nmust be compensated in the opposite direction, such that it could be meaningful to talk about cascade effects, that \\nconsist of multiple (dis)advantages, and not about a single “advantage-disadvantage” pair with fixed components. \\nMoreover, bilingualism is not the only activity with an impact on cognition, but one of the many, like exercis -\\ning navigation  skills50 or doing  music51,52. In the likely event that bilingualism and other sources of adaptation \\nco-exist in an  individual15,53, cognitive enhancements—which imply taxing some cognitive resources—cannot \\ninfinitely add up, because of the finite resources of the system. As a result, a ceiling effect of enhancement may \\nbe reached based on one environmental trigger (e.g., music), effectively rendering other triggers (e.g., bilingual \\nexperience) null, at least for some time. For example,51 compare monolingual and bilingual musicians and non-\\nmusicians and find a musical training advantage on working memory, but not a bilingual advantage. However, \\nthe expectation that it is possible to observe the cumulative effect of two enhancements is perhaps too optimistic. \\nIt is likely that musicians have already reached a cognitive peak thanks to their musical advantage, such that \\nthe effect of bilingualism could not lead to further enhancements, at least not until the first source of influence \\nwanes. Put more succinctly, if an environmental trigger has conferred a cognitive advantage that has already led \\nto superior performance in some domain, a plateau is expected after the peak point, at least until the effect gets \\nweaker as practice, use, and ability of the advantage-conferring experience changes over time.\\nThere is a way in which this point relates to age. Our review of studies that tested child populations suggests \\nthat the observed effects tend to level out with  time45,54. This fluctuation, besides being evidence for develop-\\nmental  plasticity35, can also be construed as the path towards a plateau effect: in early adulthood, performance is \\nalmost at ceiling level, such that environmental factors have less room for enhancing processes associated with \\ncognitive  control26,55. To exemplify, while bilingual toddlers  in54 are invariably associated with a disadvantage in \\nauditory word recognition, a young adult population tested for the same skill is less accurate than monolinguals, \\nyet still faster than them at word learning, suggesting that age contributed to levelling out differences between the \\ntwo groups in some domains. Similarly, the advantage of simultaneous bilingual children over early L2 learners \\nin the acquisition of early-acquired  phenomena45 disappears with time, and the two groups do not differ for \\nphenomena that are typically acquired later in life.\\nOverall, our results suggest that the cascade effects of cognitive adaptations to bilingualism (i) are not dichoto-\\nmous, (ii) possibly form part of trade-offs, whereby enhanced performance in any domain entails certain costs \\nand compensations, and (iii) are dynamic and subject to change under the influence of various environmental \\ntriggers, but also of time and developmental stage. Moreover, our results indicate that there is no domain that \\nstands out in terms of showing either advantages or  disadvantages. As Fig.\\xa0 7 shows, certain domains of testing \\nmay be more strongly associated with either hampered or enhanced performance (e.g., semantic fluency is \\noften associated with a bilingual disadvantage), but such relations are not absolute, such that it is possible that a \\ndomain that is frequently linked to a(n) (dis)advantage also shows results that go in the opposite direction. The \\nconsiderable domain overlap that is shown in Fig.\\xa0 7 illustrates this point.\\nNotwithstanding the outlined variability in our results, a pattern compatible with what has been noted in \\nthe literature can be observed: Bilingual disadvantages are often associated with the verbal domain, whereas \\nenhanced bilingual performance is found in tasks involving executive function  measures56–58. In our pool of \\ndata, the majority of bilingual disadvantages are observed primarily in language production and, to a lesser \\nextent, in speech recognition  abilities44,54. Conversely, the reported bilingual advantages manifest both (i) as \\nreduced switching/interference costs in the non-verbal  domain54,59 and (ii) in the verbal domain, as improved \\nperformance in tone/speech-in-noise  recognition44,60, picture  naming61,62, word  recall63, and letter and phonemic \\n fluency28,64.\\nAdding to advantages manifesting in tasks that test linguistic abilities, opposite bilingual effects also manifest \\nwithin the same  cognitive domain. In our database, this is exemplified  by64  and28. Both studies focus on language \\nproduction and while they report a letter fluency bilingual advantage over monolinguals, such enhancement is \\noffset by a cost in category fluency. Marsh et\\xa0al.28 attribute this finding to heightened executive processes involved \\nin letter fluency—where processes of phonological/lexical retrieval are heavily involved—as opposed to category \\nfluency, which is more closely associated with the access of semantic  knowledge65. Overall, the non-trivial sys -\\ntematicity of the relations “verbal domain–disadvantage” and “non-verbal domain–advantage” warrants more \\ndetailed investigation of the ways in which advantages and disadvantages tie with one another.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

While it can be claimed that bilingualism always entails an advantage in the sense of being \\nexposed to a different linguistic and possibly cultural  reality4, the measurable cognitive differences subsumed \\nunder the labels “bilingual advantage” and “bilingual disadvantage” are probably temporary, as language (like any \\nother trait) gradually transitions from a heavily controlled, mentally effortful process to a more automated  one67.\\nAiming to capture the bigger picture, it seems that an interesting parallel can be observed between brain and \\nbehavior.

This offers \\nsupport to recent approaches to bilingualism as a spectrum experience that permits variable modulations based \\non individual language  experiences32,73,74.\\nConclusion\\nResearch in the topic of cognitive adaptations to bilingualism has produced largely contradictory results that \\ncan be classified into three categories: positive evidence, negative evidence, and null. While many explanations \\nhave been offered for the different sets of results, a matter that has remained unaddressed is the degree to which \\nadvantages and disadvantages coexist across tasks and populations, such that they possibly rise to a balanced \\nbilingual effect. This systematic review and two quantitative analyses addressed this question in a novel way, \\nthrough representing all the outcomes reported in the analyzed studies. First, we determined that there is strong \\nevidence for the presence of bilingual adaptations (in the form of both advantages and disadvantages) in the \\nanalyzed datasets, indicating that bilingualism is indeed more likely than not to exert effects on cognition. Sec -\\nond, our quantitative analyses showed that the data support the hypothesis that positive and negative outcomes \\nare equally plentiful. This finding is in agreement with previous meta-analyses that find more advantages than \\ndisadvantages in the executive  domain19,75,76, because—under the trade-off approach we have laid out—any pos-\\nsible executive function advantages are likely offset in other cognitive domains, including possible disadvantages \\nin verbal processing tasks.\\nWe have argued that this equilibrium may not be accidental. The distribution of effects suggests that the terms \\n“bilingual advantage” and “bilingual disadvantage” should not be conceived as stand-alone effects, forming a \\nsingle “advantage/disadvantage” pair, but possibly as inseparable parts of an overall trade-off that comes in dif -\\nferent guises and forms (e.g., accuracy vs. flexibility of switching, accuracy vs. speed, affected lexical retrieval \\nvs. enhanced pragmatic monitoring, etc.). From this perspective, advantages in some cognitive measures will \\nresult in disadvantages in others, playing a zero-sum game that can be best explained through assuming dynamic \\ntrade-offs. The effects subsumed under the labels “advantage” and “disadvantage” offset each other in a way that \\nmakes them subject to change under the influence of environmental factors such as time and developmental \\nstage. To conclude, while reasoning in fixed terms may be convenient, not recognizing the composite nature of \\nboth bilingualism and its effects would pose an unnecessary limit to our understanding of bilingual cognition. It \\nis likely that future research on the topic will address the remaining open questions (cf.33) while controlling for \\nresearch practices so as to reflect the diversity of bilingualism (cf.77),\\xa0and develop a theory of the characteristics \\nof the bilingual trade-offs, hopefully as part of an overall theory of cognitive adaptations to bilingualism that \\naddresses the factors that drive the observed effects.\\nData availability\\nAll data associated to the current study are available in this published article and in the OSF project, https:// osf.  \\nio/ 8w6ux/ .\\nReceived: 7 July 2023; Accepted: 18 January 2024\\nReferences\\n 1.

This has led more than 7.3 million\\nVenezuelans to emigrate, at least 1.5 million of those to Peru, which amounted to an increase of over 4\\npercent in the Peruvian population. Venezuelan immigrants in Peru are relatively similar in cultural terms,\\nbut, on average, more skilled than Peruvians. In this paper, we first examine Venezuelans’ perceptions of\\nbeing discriminated against in Peru. Using an instrumental variable strategy, we document a causal relationship\\nbetween the level of employment in the informal sector – where most immigrants are employed – and reports of\\ndiscrimination. We then study the impact of Venezuelan migration on local’s labor market outcomes, reported\\ncrime rates, and attitudes using a variety of data sources. We find that inflows of Venezuelans to particular\\nlocations led to increased employment and income among locals, decreased reported crime, and improved\\nreported community quality. We conduct a heterogeneity analysis to identify the mechanisms behind these\\nlabor market effects and discuss the implications for Peruvian immigration policy.\\n1. Introduction\\nCrisis-driven migration flows have significantly increased in the past\\ntwo decades ( Bhabha , 2018 ). The arrival of a large number of migrants\\nand refugees has triggered fierce political disputes over its impact on\\nlocal labor markets and has been at the center of much discussion in the\\nacademic literature and in the media. While locals’ perceptions about\\nthe effects of immigration on the labor market determine their behavior\\nand attitudes towards immigrants, the way in which these perceptions\\nare formed is less well understood.\\nIn this paper, we study the economic underpinnings of hostility\\nand discrimination against Venezuelan immigrants in Peru prior to the\\nCovid-19 pandemic.1The current crisis in Venezuela has led about\\n7.3 million people to emigrate ( R4V, 2023 ). This migration wave\\nintensified in 2017, when political instability added to the worsening\\neconomic situation in the country.

We believe including the post-pandemic period in our analysis would decrease the generalizability of our findings, since it is not possible to abstract\\nfrom this enormous shock and still be able to shed light on our main questions of interest.neighboring Colombia, Brazil, and Ecuador as their destinations, at\\nthe time, the Peruvian economy was experiencing sustained economic\\ngrowth, thus about one million Venezuelans were attracted to the\\ncountry. The pull factors were strengthened by the fact that the Pe-\\nruvian government facilitated the legal immigration of Venezuelans.\\nThis large inflow of immigrants potentially put pressure on local labor\\nmarkets, especially in urban areas, and increased the negative public\\ndiscourse against immigrants in the media ( Freier et al. , 2021 ; Winter ,\\n2020 ). Some of these sources not only claimed that the large wave of\\nnewcomers had led to an increase in unemployment, but also that it\\nhad contributed to an upsurge in urban violence.\\nStudying the economic underpinnings of discrimination against mi-\\ngrants is typically hard since large migration waves affect the dynamics\\nof the labor market, and the latter, in turn, affects discrimination. This\\nimplies that researchers need separate sources of exogenous variation to\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106437', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Groeger et al.\\nidentify the causal effect of labor market outcomes on discrimination,\\nas well as the effects of migration on the labor market. In this paper, we\\nuse a specialized survey of Venezuelan immigrants in Peru to identify\\nthe causal effect of the quality of local labor markets on discrimina-\\ntion against immigrants. Then, we turn to the economic determinants\\nof attitudes towards immigrants and study the flip side of the first\\nanalysis, namely, how the presence of immigrants affects Peruvians’\\nlabor market outcomes, overall criminal activity, and their percep-\\ntions of crime and their local community. In both analyses, the main\\nidentification issue is that Venezuelans are not randomly allocated to\\nspecific locations in Peru and hence unobserved characteristics of both\\nthe location and the Venezuelans there might be correlated with local\\neconomic conditions and individual outcomes for both Venezuelans and\\nPeruvians in the same location. We account for this using different\\ninstrumental variables strategies combined with detailed controls on\\nthe local economic environment.\\nIn the first part of the analysis, we examine whether Venezuelans\\nwho live in local areas with a stronger informal labor market experience\\ndifferent levels of discrimination. A large majority of Venezuelans arriv-\\ning in Peru have taken up jobs in the informal sector, directly compet-\\ning with relatively low-skilled native workers. To causally identify the\\nrelationship, we use a shift-share instrumental variable strategy that ex-\\nploits local exposure to exogenous national-level export shocks (Jaeger\\net al., 2018). As informal employment and discrimination could both\\nbe related to other local characteristics, we also control for the local\\nindustrial structure, household expenditure, population size, distance\\nfrom the capital and center of economic activity (Lima), and, impor-\\ntantly, the number of Venezuelans based in each location prior to the\\ncurrent immigration wave, which we show to be a significant pull factor\\nfor where Venezuelans choose to settle.\\nOur results show that weaker informal labor markets lead to a\\nsignificant increase in the discrimination reported by Venezuelans in\\nPeru. A 10% increase in the informal employment rate decreases dis-\\ncrimination by 6.6%, on aggregate. This effect is larger for men than\\nfor women, with 7% and 5.8%, respectively. To put these numbers\\ninto perspective, a 10% increase in the informal employment rate\\nis equivalent to moving from the first to the third quartile of the\\ndistribution of informal employment rates across districts. The data\\nwe use also collects information on where discrimination occurs. We\\nfind that weaker informal labor markets lead to more discrimination\\nagainst men in public places and on public transit. Instead, we do\\nnot find evidence of an impact on workplace discrimination for either\\ngender. This suggests that weaker informal labor markets generate\\ngeneralized discrimination, rather than one that is workplace-based.\\nOne interesting pattern is that more educated Venezuelans are more\\nlikely to report being discriminated against when informal employment\\ndecreases. A potential explanation for this, which is consistent with\\nthe previous results, is that higher-skilled Venezuelans are disappointed\\nwith their situation in Peru, especially when they settle in areas with\\nweak informal labor markets, and the lack of opportunity is either\\ncaused by or perceived as discrimination (Guerrero-Ble et al., 2020).\\nWe then turn to examine the impact of immigration (as mea-\\nsured by changes in the number of Venezuelans as a share of the\\nlocal population) on labor market outcomes and locals’ perceptions\\non the current situation. We rely on administrative data to measure\\nthe number of Venezuelans newly registered in each district in Peru\\non a monthly basis between January 2015 and December 2020. We\\naggregate this information at the labor market level and rely on a time-\\nvarying measure of the presence of Venezuelans in each labor market,\\nwhich allows us to use repeated cross-sectional data on outcomes for\\nPeruvians and control for location and time fixed effects, as well as,\\nlocation-specific time trends. Hence, we identify the impact of the\\npresence of Venezuelans by examining how outcomes for Peruvians\\nchange when more Venezuelans arrive in a labor market, conditional\\non the trend in the outcome.It is possible that local shocks impact both the destination choice of\\nVenezuelans and outcomes for Peruvians, we thus use an instrumental\\nvariable strategy where we instrument the number of Venezuelans in\\na location with the presence of Venezuelans in that location in the\\npast, interacted with the year of observation. This is a semi-parametric\\nversion of the traditional migrant network instrument, as recommended\\nby Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020), and allows the strength of the net-\\nwork effect to potentially vary by year. An overidentification test can be\\nused to examine whether the instrument has a consistent relationship\\nover time.\\nWe find robust evidence that increased immigration from Venezuela\\nhas a positive impact on labor market outcomes for Peruvians, with\\nincreased employment rates, incomes, and expenditures. Additionally,\\nlocations that receive more immigrants have lower levels of reported\\nnon-violent crime, improved reported quality of local services, greater\\nreported trust in neighbors, and higher reported community quality.\\nOn the other hand, we find evidence that in locations with more\\nVenezuelans, Peruvians report that their community likes diversity less.\\nTaken together, our results imply that local labor markets in Peru\\nthat are more informal are better able to adapt to large migration\\ninflows both in terms of migrant assimilation and the impacts on\\nlocals. While the migration of Venezuelans to Peru is quite specific,\\nthis evidence suggests that there are perhaps unexpected downsides to\\nlabor market formalization in less-developed countries.\\nOur main contribution is to the recent literature on the impact\\nof crisis-driven migration in less developed countries.2A large group\\nof studies in this literature has focused on examining the impact of\\nSyrian refugee immigration on natives in Turkey and Jordan. The\\nresults show that these inflows of migrants and refugees reduce the\\nemployment and wages of low-skilled natives (Ceritoglu et al., 2017;\\nDel Carpio & Wagner, 2015; Tumen, 2016). There is also a growing\\nliterature studying the effects of the current Venezuelan exodus on\\nneighboring countries in Latin America. Results are more mixed than\\nin the Syrian case, and the diversity of the findings appear to relate to\\nthe conditions in the receiving economy.3Unlike most of the previous\\nstudies which find negative or null effects, we find that inflows of\\nVenezuelans to Peru lead to positive labor market effects for natives in\\ngeneral, with increased employment, incomes, and expenditures among\\nPeruvian households. We conduct a heterogeneity analysis by natives’\\ngender and skill level to shed light on the mechanisms behind this\\neffect: the results suggest that the effects stem mainly from increased\\ninformal employment among secondary-educated men and increased\\nformal employment among tertiary-educated men. High-skilled women\\nalso seem to benefit through increases in employment, potentially\\nas a result of improved child care services provided by Venezuelan\\nimmigrants.\\n2While there is a long-standing and rich literature in economics concerned\\nwith the effects of immigration on labor markets in developed countries (Bor-\\njas, 1983; Card, 2001), much less work has looked at the impact of (forced)\\nmigration in developing countries. For a general review of the literature of\\nthe impact of forced migration on host communities, see Verme and Schuettler\\n(2021).\\n3For Colombia, existing studies have mostly identified negative (Bahar\\net al., 2021; Delgado-Prieto, 2021; Lebow, 2020; Lebow et al., 2021) or\\nnull effects (Santamaria, 2022) on labor market outcomes of native workers.\\nFor Ecuador, Olivieri et al. (2020) do not find any effects on natives’ labor\\nmarket outcomes on average, but identify a deterioration of employment\\nquality and earnings among young and low-educated natives in high im-\\nmigration regions. For Peru, Boruchowicz et al. (2021) find null effects,\\nwhereas (Morales & Pierola, 2020) find small positive effects on formal\\nemployment for high-skilled and negative effects on employment and monthly\\nearnings for secondary educated natives and those with informal jobs.

While most of the liter-\\nature concentrates on developed countries (e.g., Alesina et al. , 2022 ;\\nHangartner et al. , 2019 ), there is only a small literature on the ef-\\nfects of the Venezuelan exodus on popular opinion in Latin America.\\nFor Chile, Ajzenman et al.

Exploiting rich opinion polls,\\nwe contribute to this literature by estimating the causal impact of\\nmigration on both attitudes and perceptions of natives and immigrants\\nin the same context.\\nAnother important contribution of this study is to the nascent\\nliterature using digital trace data for measurement of migration ( Böhme\\net al. , 2020 ; Hausmann et al. , 2018 ; Palotti et al. , 2020 ; Santamaria ,\\n2022 ). One of the main difficulties in examining the impact of forced\\nmigration in host countries is typically the lack of data on where mi-\\ngrants are settling. To solve this issue, we develop a publicly available\\nGoogle Trends proxy for the concentration of Venezuelan immigrants\\nacross Peruvian regions. We then estimate our preferred specification\\nusing this proxy – instead of the administrative data from Peruvian\\nauthorities – and compare the results obtained. We find that the results\\nfrom the two approaches are surprisingly similar, both in qualitative\\nand quantitative terms. We believe that our approach can be directly\\napplied to measure the local presence of Venezuelan immigrants in\\nother major host economies. Furthermore, the proposed method can\\nbe adapted flexibly to help measure other immigrant concentrations in\\nany country by varying the choice of keywords adequately. Our study\\ncan therefore help ease data limitations affecting immigration studies\\nin general.\\nThe paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe the context\\nand institutional background. Section 3 describes the data we use in\\nour analysis as well as our empirical model and identification strategy.\\nWe then present the results in Section 4, and finally we discuss policy\\nimplications and conclude in Section 5.\\n2. Background\\nVenezuela is currently experiencing the biggest crisis in recent\\nhistory. A deep economic, political and humanitarian crisis started\\nramping up with the fall in oil prices and the death of former president\\nHugo Chavez in 2013 ( Chaves-González & Echevarría Estrada , 2020 ).\\nThis has led to what some authors have called the great Venezuelan\\nexodus ( Hausmann et al. , 2018 ; Rozo & Vargas , 2021 ). In mid-2016,\\nlarge waves of migrants started to leave the country, by 2019, the main\\ndestination of migrants were Colombia (1’700,000), Peru (870,000),\\nEcuador (385,000), and Chile (371,000) (data reported in Boruchowicz\\net al. (2021 ) up to June 2019). According to recent estimates, there\\nare a total of 7.3 million Venezuelan immigrants worldwide, and the\\nnumber of Venezuelans living in Peru has increased from 6615 in 2016\\nto more than 870,000 by June 2019 (see Fig. 1), and went up to\\nover 1.5 million by 2023 ( R4V, 2023 ). This wave of immigration has\\nincreased Peru’s population by over 4 percent.\\nTraveling from Venezuela to Peru entails a journey of over 4500\\nkilometers, and before 2017 Peruvian authorities required all immi-\\ngrants to be in possession of a passport (without any visa requirements).\\nHowever, obtaining a passport in Venezuela at the time was difficult,\\nas processing times were extremely long and required high fees. In\\nlight of this situation, in 2017, the Peruvian government made it easier\\n4On the effects of immigration on crime, see also: Bell et al. (2013 )\\nand Bianchi et al. (2012 ).\\nFig. 1. Evolution of Venezuelan immigrant stock in Peru.\\nSource: Peruvian National Superintendence of Migrations.\\nfor Venezuelans to enter the country and implemented a temporary\\nresidence permit (ironically called Permiso Temporal de Permanencia ,\\nhenceforth PTP). This permit allowed immigrants to legally work and\\nstudy in the country, pay taxes, and open a bank account. According\\nto the national statistical institute (INEI), 50.2% of Venezuelan immi-\\ngrants applied for the PTP and were waiting for the decision, while\\n26.7% reported having obtained it before the ENPOVE survey interview\\nin February 2018 ( Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática ,\\n2019 ). Given the fact that PTP applicants were legally allowed to stay\\nin Peru and that most applications in 2018 were successful up to that\\npoint, the large majority of Venezuelan immigrants had a legal status\\nin Peru and were able to work in the informal or formal sector.\\nUnlike in other episodes of crisis migration, such as that of Syrian\\nrefugees during the recent civil war or Central American immigrants in\\nthe US, Venezuelan immigrants are not only very similar to Peruvians\\nin cultural terms, but are, on average, also more skilled than Peruvians.\\nAs of December 2018, 47.8% of Peruvians had less than secondary\\neducation which was true of only 17.2% of Venezuelan immigrants\\n(see Table 1). However, there is anecdotal evidence that Peruvians\\nview Venezuelans as contributing little to the economy and that their\\npresence in the country has increased criminal activities ( Janetsky ,\\n2019 ). Furthermore, there is some evidence that this has started to lead\\nto political backlash ( Winter , 2020 ).\\nBefore the pandemic, the Peruvian economy was averaging around\\na 5% annual growth rate, which made it an attractive destination for\\nmigrants. Moreover, the labor market is highly informal (and therefore\\nflexible): in 2018, only 21% of Peruvians held a formal job. Boruchow-\\nicz et al. (2021 ) show that the Venezuelan exodus had negligible effects\\non the Peruvian labor market, and argue that this is precisely due to\\nthe flexibility associated with the high levels of informality in the labor\\nmarket.5\\nVery little is known about the actual discrimination affecting\\nVenezuelan immigrants in the country. Still, it is plausible that part of\\nthe discrimination reported by immigrants is related to the way they are\\nportrayed in the media. Freier et al. (2021 ) provides a detailed analysis\\nof how the Peruvian written media has referred to Venezuelan immi-\\ngrants. They show that 46% of articles refer to Venezuelan immigrants\\nin a neutral fashion, while 28% (26%) have a negative (positive) tone.\\n5There is some contrasting evidence that the increase in Venezuelan\\nimmigrants in Peru led to small decreases in employment rates and earn-\\nings of low-skilled (and especially female) Peruvian workers in the informal\\nsector ( Asencios & Castellares , 2020 ; Morales & Pierola , 2020 ).', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Research design and data\\n3.1. Data\\nOur empirical analysis relies on an innovative combination of dif-\\nferent data sources ranging from the Peruvian census, immigrant and\\nlabor force surveys, opinion polls, and digital trace data:\\nEncuesta Dirigida a la Población Venezolana que Reside en El País (EN-\\nPOVE) is a specialized survey of Venezuelans living in Peru conducted\\nby the National Institute of Statistics (INEI) in December 2018. The\\nsample covers five main urban areas in the country where Venezuelan\\nimmigrants were most likely to be present. The survey collects data\\non the immigrant’s origin, migration date, and details on their current\\nemployment. Importantly, a full module asks about the immigrant’s\\nexperiences with locals, which includes questions about discrimination\\nand hostile attitudes towards them. The respondent’s current location is\\nidentified down to the centro poblado level, which roughly corresponds\\nto an urban neighborhood or a rural town. 48% of sample resides in\\nLima. We focus on variation in labor market opportunities at the district\\nlevel. Districts are the smallest administrative areas in Peru and are akinto counties in the US.6According to ENPOVE, 70% of Venezuelans work\\nin the same district in which they live.7\\nEncuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO) is the Peruvian version of the\\nLiving Standards Measurement Survey, e.g. a nationally representative\\nhousehold survey collected monthly on a continuous basis. For our\\nanalysis, we use data from January 2007 to December 2020. The\\nsurvey covers a wide variety of topics, including basic demographics,\\neducational background, labor market conditions, crime victimization,\\nand a module on respondent’s perceptions about the main problems in\\nthe country and trust on different local and national level institutions.\\nObservations are also spatially identified at the district level, but here\\nwe focus on variation in the Venezuelan share of the population at the\\nprovince level, of which there are 198, as these are best representative\\nof local labor markets for Peruvians.\\nLatin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) is a opinion survey con-\\nducted bi-annually in all countries in Latin America and designed to be\\nrepresentative of urban populations. This was fielded in Peru in 2010,\\n6Overall, there are 1857 districts in the country, which are grouped in 198\\nprovinces.\\n7ENPOVE does not cover enough provinces to examine cross-sectional\\nvariation at this geographical aggregation, as we do for our analysis of the\\nimpacts on Peruvians.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The survey questions are centered around\\npolitics, governance and opinions on current events.

The sample collected in Peru is a repeated\\ncross-section of about approximately 1000 observations each year. For\\nour analysis, we use data from 2013 to 2020. The survey questions\\nare centered around politics, governance, and opinions on current\\nevents. We make use of several opinion indices provided by Gallup,\\nwhich measure individual opinions on various domains. Observations\\nare spatially identified at the region level for Peru, which is our level\\nof analysis in this case (there are 25 regions in Peru).\\nPTPWe measure the location of Venezuelan immigrants on a monthly\\nbasis from January 2015 to December 2020 using administrative data\\non the district Venezuelan immigrants register at with the Peruvian au-\\nthorities to obtain access to social services. There are strong incentives\\nto register as this is also a prerequisite for applying to obtain the PTP.\\nThis data only records monthly gross arrivals so we do not know the\\noutflows of Venezuelans to other locations within Peru or out of the\\ncountry. In ENPOVE, 84% of Venezuelan immigrants in Peru report\\nhaving lived in the same district during their entire time since arriving\\nin the country. The data shows the arrival of 511,223 Venezuelans as\\nof December 2020, which, while somewhat lower than estimates of the\\nactual number of Venezuelans living in Peru, is quite substantial.\\nWe also use data from the National Census 2007 and 2017 . We use\\nthe 2017 Census data to measure the share of workers in the formal\\nand informal sector in each district as well as the total local population\\nin each district, province and region. We use the 2007 data to construct\\nboth of our instruments (discussed in more detail below) as well as to\\ncreate additional controls for the local economic environment. More\\nprecisely, in the first part of our analysis, we use information on the\\nindustrial distribution (using detailed four-digit codes) in each district,\\nwhile in the second part, we use information on the total number of\\nVenezuelans in each province in Peru.\\nTo construct the Trade shock instrument for the first part of our\\nanalysis, we also use trade data from the reports of TradeMap. From\\nthis website, we are able to identify export and import values for Peru\\non a monthly basis since 2006 at the HS 6-digit product revision. In\\naddition, correspondence tables of HS 6-digit product revision to ISIC\\n3.1 revision (United Nations) are used to harmonize products with\\ntheir corresponding industry sector in order to be matched with census\\ndata. This allows us to create a year-ISIC panel with information about\\nexports and imports for 86 industry sectors in Peru.\\nWe also create a measure of Venezuelan immigrant concentration\\nusing Google Trends in different regions of Peru in each year to be used\\nas a robustness check. In the face of severe data limitations on immi-\\ngration in many countries, Google trends has recently been proposed\\nas a tool for the measurement and prediction of migration (Böhme\\net al., 2020). We select keywords that Venezuelan immigrants in Peru\\nsearch for through the Google search engine to proxy for immigrant\\nstocks at the regional level.8We expect these terms to be frequently\\nconsulted by all Venezuelan immigrants abroad (and not by Peruvians)\\nand, hence, their relative search frequencies to be indicative of the\\n8Particularly, we extract Google Trends at the region-year level for the\\ncombination of the following acronyms/keywords: ‘‘PTP’’ ( permiso temporal\\nde permanencia - work permit for immigrants in Peru), ‘‘SAIME’’ ( Servicio\\nAdministrativo de Identificación, Migración 𝑦Extranjería - Venezuelan agency for\\ncivil registry services including passport issuance for migrants abroad), and ‘‘La\\nPatilla’’ (Venezuelan news agency).distribution of Venezuelan immigration in Peru across regions and\\ntime. We follow Santamaria (2022) in calculating a relative measure\\nof Venezuelan immigrant concentration by region and year in Peru.\\nWe then use this measure in our preferred specification, replacing the\\nadministrative data on the location of Venezuelans to estimate the\\nimpact of Venezuelan immigration on Peruvian labor market outcomes.\\n3.2. Outcome variables\\nIn the first part of our analysis, we examine the impact of local\\nlabor market conditions on self-reported information on experiencing\\ndiscrimination as reported by Venezuelans surveyed in ENPOVE. Over-\\nall, 36.4% of Venezuelans report having experienced discrimination,\\nwith this being slightly more common among women (38.1%) than\\nmen (35.0%). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of reported discrimination\\nin different districts in Peru. There is clearly variation both across\\nand within regions. Report discrimination is least common in Tumbes\\n(23.4%), which is the typical entry point to Peru for Venezuelans and\\ncurrently hosts 5% of ENPOVE sample, while Cusco and Lima, where\\n7% and 48% of Venezuelans are located, show the highest (47.8%)\\nand median levels (37.1%) of reported discrimination, respectively.\\nIndividuals who experienced discrimination are then asked in which lo-\\ncations did the episode took place. Among all Venezuelans surveyed in\\nENPOVE, including those not reporting being discriminated against, the\\nthree most common locations are, at work (20.0%), on the streets/in\\npublic places (25.0%), and on public transit (9.8%).\\nIn the second part of our analysis, we examine the impact of\\nVenezuelans on a wide variety of outcomes for Peruvians. First, we ex-\\namine the impact on labor market outcomes, specifically employment,\\nformal employment, log wages if employed, log household income, and\\nlog household expenditure. Second, we examine the impact on reported\\ncrime and opinions about personal safety. Specifically, we look at the\\nreported (log) number of crimes in each district from administrative\\ndata split into non-violent and violent crimes (data starting in 2011,\\nmeans 3.54 for log violent crime and 3.31 for log non-violent crime),\\nfrom ENAHO whether crime is a major national problem (12.7%), from\\nLAPOP whether they have been a crime victim in the last two months\\n(32.0%), and standardized variables from LAPOP on opinions about\\nneighborhood safety and from Gallup on personal security. Lastly, we\\nexamine the impact on community outcomes. Specifically, we look at\\nstandardized indices measuring the quality of local services and trust in\\nneighbors from LAPOP and indices from Gallup on community attach-\\nment, the quality of the local community, and whether the community\\nlikes diversity.\\n3.3. Control variables\\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the control variables\\nused in each analysis. The information we have available from each\\ndataset varies, but we can always control for age, gender, education,\\nmarital status, whether employed, and household size. ENPOVE collects\\nadditional relevant data about Venezuelans including how long they\\nhave been in Peru, whether they work in the formal sector, their\\nlabor income, their occupation, and the socioeconomic status of their\\nhousehold. ENAHO collects very similar data from Peruvians. Neither\\nLAPOP nor Gallup collect detailed data on employment and occupation.\\nWe now describe our main explanatory variables.\\nIn the first analysis, the main explanatory variable is the informal\\nemployment rate measured in the 2017 census in the district in which\\nVenezuelans reside, which has a mean of 31.2%. This is noticeably\\nlower than the overall informal employment rate of 59.9% among\\nPeruvians surveyed in ENAHO, indicating that Venezuelans are gen-\\nerally settling in areas in Peru with less formal unemployment. Only\\n8.0% of Venezuelan immigrants surveyed in ENPOVE are employed in\\nthe formal sector (i.e., they have an employment contract with social\\nsecurity benefits), hence the employment rate in the informal sector', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

One worry is that Venezuelans now may be attracted to\\nplaces for similar reasons as Venezuelans in 2007.

Results\\n4.1. Labor market conditions and discrimination\\nTable 2 shows our main results on the effects of local labor mar-\\nket conditions on self reported discrimination. We first present the\\nOLS results, and then turn to comment on the estimates from our IV\\nspecification. Importantly, given that the types of jobs in which men\\nand women work differ, we show the main results for the full sample\\nof immigrants who responded to the survey and split the sample by\\ngender.\\nColumns (1)–(3) show the OLS relationship between the (log) local\\ninformal employment rate and the reports of discrimination. In the\\nthree panels, this relationship shows small and insignificant coeffi-\\ncients. As discussed above, these OLS results cannot be interpreted\\nas causal due to an endogeneity issue that arises from the fact that\\nimmigrants make their location decisions based on the local labor\\nmarket conditions. To overcome this problem, we use an instrumental\\nvariable strategy in which we exploit exogenous variation in the impact\\nof national level export shocks on local (informal) employment rates\\ndepending on detailed measures of the local industry composition.\\nSpatial variation in both the informal employment rate in 2017 and\\nthe instrument are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Importantly,\\nthere is clear variation in both dimensions, across and within regions.\\nThe first stage relationship is shown graphically in Fig. 5. An increase inpredicted local exports has a positive relationship with formal employ-\\nment rates. Consequently, higher predicted exports imply that a lower\\nshare of people work in the informal sector, where most Venezuelan\\nimmigrants are employed. The full results of the first stage relationship\\nbetween export shocks and informal employment rates are provided\\nin Table A.1. Using a linear specification for the first stage yields a\\nvery strong instrument, with an F-stat for the excluded instrument that\\nranges between 318 and 693, even while controlling for a number of\\nother measures of the local economic environment.\\nColumn (4) in Table 2 shows the second stage results from our\\nIV strategy. The first thing to note is that the IV coefficient is much\\nlarger than the OLS one. This difference indicates that Venezuelan\\nimmigrants are selecting themselves into labor markets where there is\\nmore discrimination. This is consistent with the idea that immigrants\\nare willing to deal with more discrimination as long as the labor market\\noffers better opportunities and higher wages. The selection seems more\\nrelevant for men than for women.\\nHigher employment rates in the informal sector cause a reduction\\nin the level of discrimination reported by Venezuelan immigrants. On\\naverage, a 10 percent increase in informal employment in a district\\ncauses a 6.6% reduction in discrimination. Furthermore, the results\\nshow that men are more likely to suffer from discrimination due to\\nchanges in the informal employment rate: a 10% increase in employ-\\nment reduces discrimination against men by 7%, while for women, the\\npoint estimate indicates a decrease of 5.7% which, however, is not\\nstatistically significant.\\nImportantly, the reduction in discrimination as a response is not\\nexplained by having more exposure in the labor market: as we show\\nin Table A.2, variation in local informal employment is unrelated to\\nthe Venezuelan immigrants’ probability of being employed. While this\\nmay be a bit surprising, we have to take into account that 94% of\\nVenezuelan immigrants are employed, so there is little margin for\\nimprovement. Additionally, for men, we observe a negative effect on\\nwages with the point estimate indicating a reduction of 9.5% for a 10%', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We show the OLS and IV\\nresults for our preferred specification, the one that includes all controls\\nand fixed effects. Discrimination at work seems to respond the least to\\nlocal employment, with a coefficient that implies that a 10% increase\\nin informal employment leads discrimination to decrease by 2.8%,\\nalthough the relationship is not statistically significant. Interestingly,\\nthere is a clear gender split on whether discrimination occurs in streets\\nand public spaces. A 10% increase in informal employment causes a\\ndecrease in discrimination against men in streets and public spaces of\\nabout 10%, with no significant change in discrimination against women\\nin these spaces. Finally, discrimination in public transit responds sim-\\nilar regardless of the gender, with reductions of about 4.5%–5% in\\ndiscrimination for a 10% increase in the informal employment rate.\\nThese results are consistent with a situation in which weak local la-\\nbor markets create general resentment towards Venezuelan immigrants,\\nwhich leads to discrimination by people who do not share a work-\\nplace with Venezuelans. There are many reasons why this could then\\nlead to more perceived discrimination ‘on the streets’ and in ‘public\\ntransit’, rather than ‘at work’. One explanation in line with the inter-\\ngroup contact theory is that working with immigrants implies repeated\\ninteractions and typically creates a bond that can lead to reductions\\nin natives’ discriminatory attitudes towards immigrants (Steinmayr,\\n2021).14\\n14We also examined whether the results varied depending on how long\\nVenezuelans had been in Peru. We found that the impact of local labor markets\\nis larger for individuals (in particular men) who arrived more recently in Peru\\n(after February 2018). However, it is difficult to know how to interpret these\\nresults because of the potential changing selection of migrants over time, in\\nother words separating cohort and time in the country effects.4.2. Immigration and local’s labor market outcomes\\nIn the previous section, we established that labor market conditions\\nhave a causal effect on the way Venezuelan immigrants perceive to be\\ntreated by locals: lower unemployment in the informal labor market\\nleads to a decrease in discrimination. We now turn to study the flip-side\\nof this question, namely, the way in which the presence of Venezuelans\\naffect Peruvians’ labor market outcomes and their perceptions about\\ncrime, corruption, and public good provision at the local level. To\\nconduct this analysis we estimate Eq. (3).\\nTable 5 shows the results on the impact of the presence of Venezue-\\nlan immigrants on Peruvian’s labor market outcomes. We report our\\nOLS estimates with different sets of controls (Panels A and B). We\\nthen report our aggregate IV estimates (Panel C), along those from\\na subgroup specification by gender (Panels D and E, respectively). A\\nhigher number of Venezuelan immigrants in a given province corre-\\nlates with higher levels of employment (but not formal employment)\\nfor Peruvians once we include province and time fixed effects as\\nwell as province-specific trends (Panel B). Additionally, households in\\nprovinces with more immigrants report higher incomes and expen-\\nditures.

Robust standard errors clustered at province level in parentheses. Share of Venezuelans as proxied by our Google Trends measure (standardized\\nwith mean zero and standard deviation one) at the region-year level as discussed in the paper. Log Share VZs in the province in 2007 interacted with year fixed effects are used\\nas instruments for the Google Trends Venezuelan immigration measure. All regressions include controls for a quadratic in age, education, marital status, and household size.\\nTo check the robustness of these results, we re-estimate the IV speci-\\nfication based on Eq. (3), but using our Google Trends measure instead\\nof the administrative data from the Peruvian authorities to proxy for\\nVenezuelan immigration. Note that in this approach the identifying\\nvariation comes from the more aggregate level of the Peruvian regions,\\nas Google Trends is not available at our preferred level of analysis\\n(provinces) in Peru. The results are presented in Table 6. Despite the\\ndifferences in the source and construction of the immigration measure,\\nthe IV results in Panel C are remarkably similar, both in qualitative and\\nquantitative terms. This suggests that measurement error and under-\\nreporting in the administrative data are not biasing our results. Perhaps\\nmore importantly, it also demonstrates that our approach is capable\\nof measuring Venezuelan immigration in Peru successfully and likely\\ncould be used in other contexts to obtain reliable causal estimates of\\nthe impact of immigration on natives’ labor market outcomes even in\\nthe absence of high-quality administrative data.\\nIn the last part of our analysis, we shed more light on the potential\\nmechanisms behind the positive effects of Venezuelan immigration on\\nPeruvian labor market outcomes. To this end, we conduct a heterogene-\\nity analysis by natives’ gender and skill level, the results of which are\\npresented in Table 7. Focusing on male labor market outcomes, we find\\nlarger impacts on the employment of medium- and high-skilled men\\n(with completed secondary or tertiary education, respectively), as well\\nas on income and expenditure. Interestingly, increased employment\\namong high-skilled men seems to be driven mainly by increased formal\\nemployment which is not the case for medium-skilled men.\\nFor women, the positive impacts on income and expenditure are\\nconcentrated among low and high-skilled individuals. For them, the\\nresults suggest that the effect is driven by increased (informal) em-\\nployment. For the low-skilled, wage information is missing for most\\nworkers, so increased income and expenditure could reflect increased\\nwages or hours of work or (as many of these women are not working\\nfull-time) increased earnings of their partner.\\nThe positive impact of Venezuelan immigration on Peruvian labor\\nmarket outcomes has a number of potential explanations. The arrival ofVenezuelans may have generally expanded the economic opportunities\\nfor Peruvian because of their higher levels of potential productivity,\\ndue to higher human capital and concentration in low wage jobs.\\nFurthermore, most of the informal jobs taken by Venezuelans are in the\\nservice sector which potentially could have freed up time, especially\\nfor Peruvian women to be more engaged in the labor market. This may\\nexplain the results for high skilled individuals in particular.\\n4.3. Immigration, crime and communities\\nOne widespread claim mentioned in some media reports is that\\nVenezuelan migration led to an increase in crime (Freier et al., 2021).\\nWe test whether this claim is supported by the data in Table 8, where\\nwe use administrative information on the number of non-violent and\\nviolent crimes reported in each municipality, the personal security\\nindex from Gallup, and reports on whether crime is perceived as a\\nmajor problem in ENAHO. The structure of this table is the same as\\nthe previous one, with Panel C as our preferred specification.\\nConsistent with the idea that Venezuelan inflow lead to improve-\\nments in labor market conditions, we observe that locations that re-\\nceived a larger number of immigrants have lower number of reported\\nnon-violent crimes (column 2). This effect is large with a double of\\nVenezuelans in a province leading to a 42% decline in reported non-\\nviolent crimes. Individuals are also less likely to report that crime is a\\nmajor national problem, this is true for both men and women.\\nFinally, in Table 9 we examine the effects of immigration on local\\ncommunities. Consistent with our previous findings, Peruvians living\\nin areas with a higher share of Venezuelan immigrants report that the\\nquality of local services and community quality are higher and that they\\nhave greater trust in their neighbors. However, in these locations they\\nalso report that the community is less likely to value diversity. In gen-\\neral, these findings are stronger for men than for women. It is important\\nto note that these findings could be driven by the positive impact that\\nVenezuelans have on the labor market outcomes of Peruvians.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Groeger et al.\\nOverall, we find that increased Venezuelan migration leads to im-\\nprovements in both objective and subjective measures of the lives of\\nPeruvians living in the same locations. This may explain why, even\\nthough some media has discussed Venezuelans in a negative light, there\\nhas been little political backlash against them in Peru up to this point\\nin time.\\n5. Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we study the economic underpinnings of hostility\\nand discrimination against immigrants. In our analysis, we first use\\na specialized survey of Venezuelan immigrants in Peru to identify the\\ncausal effect of local labor market conditions on discrimination against\\nimmigrants. Then, we study the flip-side of this analysis, namely, how\\ndoes the presence of Venezuelan immigrants affect Peruvians’ labor\\nmarket outcomes, local crime, and their perceptions about security and\\ntheir local community.\\nWe document a causal relationship between the level of employ-\\nment in the informal sector – where most immigrants are employed\\n– and reports of discrimination. While fears of political backlash and\\nanti-immigrant sentiment persist, we do not find any evidence that\\nVenezuelan immigration to Peru had negative labor market conse-\\nquences for Peruvians or led to increased crime. In fact, the opposite\\nseems to be true with higher local Venezuelan immigration leading to\\nlower crime rates and more educated natives benefiting from higher\\nemployment and income, while low-skilled natives remain generally\\nunaffected. These results stand in contrast to those published by the\\nPeruvian Central Bank that identify negative effects on employment\\nand earnings as a result of Venezuelan immigration, concentrated\\namong Peruvian women (Asencios & Castellares, 2020).\\nOur results suggest that recent policy changes by Peruvian authori-\\nties to limit regular immigration from Venezuela are unnecessary.15The\\nInternational Monetary Fund estimates that 0.4 percentage points of\\nPeruvian real GDP can be attributed to Venezuelan immigrants in 2021\\nand argues that ‘‘the long-term benefits of this migration episode will\\ndepend on the speed of labor market integration of entrants [...]’’ (IMF,\\n2020, p. 6). In light of these results, a better approach would be to\\nhelp facilitate their arrival, regularization, and (formal) labor market\\nintegration (Guerrero-Ble et al., 2020). This would help realize the\\nbenefits that the skilled Venezuelan labor force in Peru offers and\\npotentially generate higher incomes, yield greater fiscal revenues, and\\nalso generate support for Peru’s pension system.\\nBeyond this, taken together, our results imply that local labor\\nmarkets in Peru that are more informal are better able to adapt to large\\nmigration inflows both in terms of migrant assimilation and the impacts\\non locals. While the migration of Venezuelans to Peru is quite specific,\\nthis evidence suggests that there are perhaps unexpected downsides to\\nlabor market formalization in less-developed countries.\\nFinally, our study also highlights a novel approach for measuring\\nVenezuelan immigrant concentration across Peruvian regions using\\nGoogle Trend for Venezuelan-specific keywords. Comparing the causal\\nestimates based on this measure with those using our preferred measure\\nfrom administrative records, we obtain remarkably similar results. We\\nbelieve that the proposed approach holds promise to significantly ease\\ndata limitations for studies on the impact of immigration, especially in\\ndeveloping countries where reliable measures of immigrant settlement\\nare often unavailable. Future work should investigate to which extent\\nthese findings can be generalized beyond the context of our study\\nto provide further methodological guidance to empirical immigration\\nstudies.\\n15E.g., since June 2019, Venezuelans who want to legally enter Peru have\\nbeen required to apply for a humanitarian visa in specific Peruvian consulates\\nabroad and provide documentation that is difficult to obtain, such as passports.Table A.1\\nFirst-stage regression for quality of local labor markets\\nOverall Men Women\\nOutcome: Log local informal Emp rate\\nExport shock in year prior Oct 2017 −3.358** −3.188** −3.602**\\n(1.315) (1.297) (1.351)\\nLog local total population 2017 0.032 0.029 0.034\\n(0.024) (0.026) (0.024)\\nLog local Venezuelans 2007 −0.034* −0.031 −0.035*\\n(0.019) (0.020) (0.019)\\nLog mean local expenditure 2013 −0.433*** −0.440*** −0.424***\\n(0.114) (0.114) (0.115)\\nLog agriculture rate 2007 −0.037 −0.033 −0.042\\n(0.040) (0.039) (0.041)\\nLog manufacturing rate 2007 0.143** 0.156** 0.128*\\n(0.067) (0.069) (0.067)\\nLog travel duration to Lima 0.034 0.037* 0.030\\n(0.021) (0.022) (0.021)\\nR-squared 0.821 0.825 0.825\\nObservations 7869 4176 3693\\nRobust standard errors clustered at centro poblado level in parentheses.

A filamentous  and fluffy flocculant  material,  namely  slime-like  substances  \\n(SLS), was gradually  accumulated  in the bioreactor  after the cease of methanogenic  activity.  \\nThe accumulation  of SLS was followed  by a decrease  in the removal  efficiencies  and a de- \\nterioration  in the performance.  Selected  characteristics  of SLS were investigated  to explore  \\nthe causes of its formation  and the effect of SLS on the UASB performance.  Results  showed  \\nthat glycerol  fermentation  and sulfate reduction  processes  taking place in the reactor  were \\nmainly  accomplished  in the bottom  part of the UASB reactor,  as the sludge concentration  in \\nthe bottom  was higher.  The accumulation  of SLS in the UASB reactor  caused  sludge flota- \\ntion that further  led to biomass  washout,  which decreased  the sulfate and glycerol  removal  \\nefficiencies.  Batch activity  tests performed  with granular  sludge (GS), slime-covered  gran- \\nular sludge (SCGS) and SLS showed  that there was no difference  between  GS and SLS in \\nthe mechanism  of glycerol  fermentation  and sulfate reduction.  However,  the specific  sul- \\nfate reduction  rate of GS was higher than that of SLS, while SLS showed  a higher glycerol  \\nfermentation  rate than that of GS. The different  rates in GS and SLS were attributed  to the \\nhigher relative  abundances  of fermentative  microorganisms  found in SLS and higher rela- \\ntive abundances  of sulfate reducing  bacteria  (SRB) found in GS. \\n© 2023 The Research  Center for Eco-Environmental  Sciences,  Chinese  Academy  of \\nSciences.

The success  of the sul- \\nfate reduction  process  has been proven  using a variety  of car- \\nbon sources,  such as methanol  ( Vallero  et al., 2003 ), ethanol  \\n( Wu et al., 2018 ), butanol  ( Sarti and Zaiat, 2011 ), or crude glyc- \\nerol ( Fernández-Palacios  et al., 2019 ). Following  the sulfate  \\nreduction  to sulfide,  recovering  valuable  metals  from metal-  \\nsulfides  precipitation  has been applied  in full-scale  installa-  \\ntions by Paques  company  ( Huisman  et al., 2006 ). Further  par- \\ntial oxidation  of sulfide  to elemental  sulfur as a value-added  \\nproduct  to valorize  S-rich effluents  has also been reported  re- \\ncently ( Mora et al., 2020a ). \\nIn order to further  extend  the application  of valorizing  \\nsulfate-rich  effluents,  it is necessary  to improve  the robust-  \\nness of biological  processes  by stabilizing  the bioreactor,  op- \\ntimizing  operating  conditions  and avoiding  inhibitory  com- \\npounds  accumulation.  Management  strategies  that are insuf- \\nficiently  evaluated  may exacerbate  risks, which further  re- \\nsults in unexpected  process  failure  and economic  losses from \\ntheir commercial  application  ( Westerholm  et al., 2018 ). Sev- \\neral problems  have been identified  in the long-term  opera-  \\ntion of UASB reactors.  For example,  fat and oil attached  onto \\nthe biomass  or the high up-flow  velocity  has been reported  \\nto lead to sludge  flotation  and the washout  of biomass,  thus \\ndecreasing  the COD removal  efficiency  (RE) and leading  to \\nprocess  failure  ( Jeganathan  et al., 2006 ; Rizvi et al., 2015 ). \\nLu et al. (2015b)  also described  that the lack of consump-  \\ntion of excess  extracellular  polymeric  substances  produced  \\nand the biogas generated  in an UASB reactor  treating  starch-  \\nrich wastewater  resulted  in the flotation  of sludge  that was \\nnot able to settle, which eventually  led to sludge  washout  \\nand the clogging  of the outlet of the reactor.  The required  \\ncleaning  procedures  due to clogged  outlets  or the reinocula-  \\ntion of biomass  due to washout  increase  operating  costs. Fur- \\nthermore,  when treating  some specific  wastewater  (such as \\nmethanol-containing  wastewater)  in UASB reactors,  the dis- \\nintegration  of GS increased  the washout  of sludge,  which not \\nonly reduced  the quality  of the outlet and decreased  the COD \\nRE, but also increased  the risk of failure  ( Lu et al., 2015a ). \\nTherefore,  long-term  evaluation  of the stability  performance  \\nof reactors  for sulfate-rich  effluents  treatment  is needed.  \\nMany studies  have already  reported  several  factors  affect-  \\ning the anaerobic  treatment  of sulfate-rich  wastewaters  dur- \\ning the long-term  operation,  including  the carbon  source  type, \\ntemperature,  pH, sulfate  loading  rate and carbon  to sulfur \\n(C/S) ratio ( Lopes et al., 2007 ; Mora et al., 2020b ; Shin et al., \\n1996 ; Vallero  et al., 2004 ). Anaerobic  methanogenic  sludge  \\ncan be adapted  to sulfidogenic  conditions  in order to achieve  \\nthe treatment  of sulfate-rich  wastewaters  ( Lens et al., 2002 ). \\nHowever,  it can take a long time for SRB to outcompete  \\nmethanogens.  In order to adapt to the sulfate  reduction  condi- \\ntions, previous  studies  showed  some alternatives  to speed up \\nthe start-up  of the process  such as adding  a pure culture  of SRB \\n( Omil et al., 1997b ) or using SRB enriched-biomass  to target \\nspecific  organic  compounds  ( Kaksonen  and Puhakka,  2007 ). In addition,  an optimum  COD/S-SO  4 2 −ratio may also accelerate  \\nthe adaptation  period.  Fernández-Palacios  et al. (2019) inves- \\ntigated  different  sulfate  and organic  loading  rates in a sulfi- \\ndogenic  UASB reactor.  It took 30 days after the inoculation  of \\nthe reactor  to reach over 80% of sulfate  RE at COD/S-SO  4 2- ra- \\ntio of 3.8 g O 2 /g S-SO 4 2 −, while only 16 days after the inocula-  \\ntion, sulfate  RE reached  an 80% at COD/S-SO  4 2- ratio of 5.4 g \\nO 2 /g S-SO 4 2- and an organic  loading  rate of 15.8 kg O 2 /m 3 /day \\n( Fernández-Palacios  et al., 2021 ). Temperature  shocks  could \\nalso be a strategy  to speed up the process  of sulfidogenesis  \\noutcompetition  over methanogenesis  ( Jung et al., 2019 ). \\nIn addition,  sludge  granulation  is an indispensable  and \\ncritical  factor for the robust treatment  of wastewater.  Gran- \\nular biomass  makes  a significant  contribution  in maintain-  \\ning the dynamic  balance  and the stability  of reactors  oper- \\nation ( Lu et al., 2015a ). However,  some studies  found that \\nnon-granular  particles  were formed  during  sulfate  reduction  \\nprocesses.  For example,  Vallero  et al. (2003) reported  the for- \\nmation  of thin fluffy flocculent  particles  in the treatment  \\nof synthetic  wastewater  containing  methanol  and sulfate  in \\nan UASB reactor  inoculated  with GS. Similarly,  granules  were \\ndisintegrated  and filamentous  and fluffy particles  aggregated  \\nin an expanded  GS bed reactor  for sulfate  reduction  using \\nmethanol  ( Weijma  et al., 2000 ). Weijma  et al. (2000) reported  \\nnegative  effects  of sulfate  reduction  on granulation.  How- \\never, there is a lack of previous  studies  in the characteriza-  \\ntion of fluffy flocculent  particles,  their formation  and poten-  \\ntial effects  on bioreactor  performance  as often they are not \\npositive.  \\nWhen acetate,  cheese  whey, pig slurry, crude glycerol  and \\nvinasses  were selected  as carbon  sources  for sulfate  reduc-  \\ntion process,  crude glycerol  showed  better results  and it was \\nthe most promising  carbon  source  to reduce  sulfate  compared  \\nwith others tested carbon  sources  ( Mora et al., 2018 ). Crude \\nglycerol  is an inexpensive  by-product  mainly  produced  in the \\nbiodiesel  production  industry.  Approximately,  0.1 kg of crude \\nglycerol  is produced  per kg of biodiesel  ( Kumar  et al., 2019 ). As \\na way to valorize  this waste product  from the biodiesel  indus-  \\ntry, crude glycerol  has been applied  in many processes  such as \\nthe bioconversion  of glycerol  to biodiesel  ( Chen et al., 2018 ), \\nmethane  production  and hydrogen  production  in anaerobic  \\ndigestion  ( Baba et al., 2013 ), composting  ( Fehmberger  et al., \\n2020 ) and sulfate  reduction  ( Mora et al., 2020a , 2020b ). How- \\never, in a previous  study ( Fernández-Palacios  et al., 2021 ), \\nthe long-term  performance  of an UASB to treat sulfate-rich  \\nwastewater  using crude glycerol  as a carbon  source  lead to the \\ndecrease  of sulfate  and organic  compounds  removal  efficien-  \\ncies, accompanied  by the accumulation  of a sticky flocculent  \\nSLS that surrounded  the granular  biomass.  The present  work \\naims at characterizing  such SLS that accumulated  in the UASB \\nreactor,  exploring  the causes  of its formation  and the effect \\nthat this substance  can have on the stability  of the UASB per- \\nformance  over long-term  periods.  Batch activity  experiments  \\nwere set up to determine  the difference  between  GS and SLS \\nin the rates and the mechanism  of sulfate  reduction  and or- \\nganic compounds  fermentation.  SLS was characterized  from a \\nphysical-chemical  point of view including  the analysis  of mi- \\ncrobial  diversity,  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM), fourier  \\ntransform  infrared  spectroscopy  (FTIR) and fatty acid methyl  \\nesters (FAMEs).

Materials  and methods  \\n1.1. Experimental  setup of the sulfidogenic  UASB reactor  \\nA 2.5 L UASB reactor  was used for the treatment  of sulfate-rich  \\nwastewater  using crude glycerol  as carbon  source  to produce  \\nsulfide.  Six sampling  ports located  along the UASB reactor  (at \\n7, 20, 30, 45, 54 and 72 cm from the bottom  to the top of the \\nUASB),  named  UASB1  to UASB6,  respectively,  were used to col- \\nlect samples  along the height of the reactor  during  its long- \\nterm operation.  A schematic  diagram  of the process  is pre- \\nsented  in Appendix  A Fig. S1. The UASB reactor  was operated  \\nunder constant  conditions  for 639 days, and the sulfate  inlet \\nconcentration  was set to 250 mg S-SO 4 2 −/L, while the crude \\nglycerol  to sulfate  ratio (TOC/sulfate)  was steadily  maintained  \\nat 1.5 ±0.3 g C/g S. Detailed  operating  conditions  of the UASB \\nreactor  are presented  in Appendix  A Table S1. GS to inoculate  \\nthe reactor  was obtained  from a full-scale  anaerobic  UASB di- \\ngester from a pulp and paper recycling  industry  (UIPSA,  Spain).  \\nThe initial volatile  suspended  solids (VSS) concentration  of \\nGS was 27.1 g VSS/L. However,  the UASB reactor  accumulated  \\nviscous,  flocculent  SLS along the operation,  which are shown  \\nin Appendix  A Fig. S2. UASB dimensions,  equipment,  mineral  \\nmedium  composition  and crude glycerol  characteristics  are \\nfurther  detailed  in Fernández-Palacios  et al. (2021) . \\n1.2. Assessment  of stratification  in the UASB reactor  \\nThe stratification  of the UASB reactor  was assessed  by col- \\nlecting  samples  from six sampling  ports of the UASB reactor  \\nunder two different  situations:  on day 198, when the reactor  \\nwas properly  operating  under sulfidogenic  conditions,  and on \\nday 575, when a large amount  of SLS had already  accumu-  \\nlated in the reactor  and sulfate  RE were dramatically  reduced.  \\nThe analysis  of the inlet, outlet and the sampling  ports of the \\nreactor  included  monitoring  of sulfate,  thiosulfate,  total dis- \\nsolved  sulfide  (TDS), volatile  fatty acids (VFAs),  glycerol,  total \\norganic  carbon  (TOC), total inorganic  carbon  (TIC) and total \\ncarbon  (TC). The calculating  process  of volumetric  rates and \\nmean cell residence  time (MCRT)  are presented  in Appendix  \\nA supplementary  methods.  The sludge  particle  size was as- \\nsessed  at different  bed heights  of the UASB reactor  (UASB1,  \\nUASB2  and UASB3)  on days 50, 149 and 230, where the parti- \\ncle size distribution  (PSD) and the median  diameter  of sludge  \\nparticles  (D(0.5))  were detected.  D(0.5) was chosen,  because  the \\nmedian  is relatively  unaffected  by skewed  distributions  or ex- \\ntreme scores at end of distribution,  compared  to the mean \\n( Field, 2013 ). \\n1.3. Batch tests \\nSince VFAs (mainly  acetate  and propionate)  are reported  as \\nthe most common  intermediate  products  of glycerol  degra- \\ndation  ( Bertolino  et al., 2014 ; Dinkel  et al., 2010 ; Mora et al., \\n2020b ; Zhou et al., 2022 ); acetate,  propionate  and glycerol  were \\nused as carbon  sources  to study the sulfate  reduction  process  \\nin batch tests. In order to study whether  the decrease  of the \\nsulfate  RE in the UASB reactor  was due to the presence  of \\nSLS, sludge  was collected  from the UASB reactor  on day 315 (when SLS covered  GS) and on day 431 (when a large amount  \\nof SLS had already  accumulated  in the reactor),  as shown  in \\nAppendix  A Fig. S2. Table 1 summarizes  the operating  condi- \\ntions of activity  tests performed  with different  carbon  sources.  \\nThe sludge  collected  from UASB1  on day 315 was separated  \\ninto GS and slime-covered  granular  sludge  (SCGS)  (Appendix  A \\nFig. S3). The SCGS was the sludge  taken directly  from the reac- \\ntor without  any treatment,  which contained  GS covered  with \\nSLS, whereas  GS was granular  sludge  that had been cleaned  to \\nremove  SLS. The cleaning  process  is presented  in Appendix  A \\nSupplementary  data. 150 mL of mineral  medium  were fed to \\nboth GS and SCGS, and acetate  and propionate  were added as \\ncarbon  sources.  The initial concentrations  were set to main- \\ntain the same conditions  as the TOC/S ratio used along the \\nlong-term  UASB operation.  \\nDue to the low concentration  of GS at UASB1,  where almost  \\nall the biomass  was completely  surrounded  by SLS (Appendix  \\nA Fig. S2C) on day 431, the sludge  collected  by that time was \\nfrom UASB6.  The sludge  collected  from UASB6  on day 431 was \\ndivided  into GS and SLS. The GS and SLS were fed with 150 mL \\nof mineral  medium  and pure glycerol  (99%, Panreac,  Spain) as \\nthe carbon  source.  \\nOnce the sludge,  mineral  medium  and carbon  sources  were \\nadded to the serum bottles,  the gas phase of the bottles  was \\nrefilled  with N 2 . Then bottles  were immediately  covered  with \\nrubber  stoppers  and aluminum  caps and incubated  at 35 ±1 °C \\nand 150 r/min in a constant  temperature  shaker  (NB-T205,  N- \\nBiotek).  All batch tests were carried  out in duplicate.  \\n1.4. Analytical  methods  \\nSulfur compounds  analyzed  included  sulfate,  thiosulfate  and \\nTDS. TDS was analyzed  off-line  by a sulfide  selective  elec- \\ntrode (9616BNWP,  Thermo  Scientific,  USA) connected  to a \\nbenchtop  meter (Symphony,  VWR, USA). Before TDS measure-  \\nments,  samples  were diluted  one-to-two  for UASB samples  \\nand one-to-twenty  for activity  tests samples  with a sulfide  \\nantioxidant  buffer (SAOB),  which composition  is described  by \\nMora et al. (2020a)  . Sulfate  and thiosulfate  were analyzed  by \\nion chromatography  (ICS-2000  system,  Dionex,  USA) with a \\nsuppressed  conductivity  detector  using an IonPac  AS18-HC  \\ncolumn  (4 ×250 mm, Dionex,  USA). Prior to the analysis  of \\nsulfate  and thiosulfate,  samples  were bubbled  with nitrogen  \\nto avoid chemical  oxidation  of sulfide  and diluted  to one fifth \\nwith ultrapure  water. \\nPrior to the analysis  of carbon  compounds,  samples  were \\nalso bubbled  with nitrogen.  Volatile  fatty acids (VFAs) and \\nalcohols  (ethanol,  1,3-propanediol,  n-butanol,  2,3-butanediol)  \\nwere measured  by high-performance  liquid chromatography  \\n(HPLC,  Ultimate  3000, Dionex,  USA) equipped  with an ICSep \\nICE-CPREGEL  87H3 column  (7.8 mm ×150 mm) and a variable  \\nwavelength  detector  at 210 nm with a 6 mmol/L  H 2 SO 4 mo- \\nbile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.  Samples  for VFAs and \\nalcohols  were not diluted.  \\nTotal organic  carbon  (TOC), total inorganic  carbon  (TIC) and \\ntotal carbon  (TC) were determined  in a TOC analyzer  (multi \\nN/C 2100S, analytikjena,  Germany)  equipped  with a furnace  \\nat the catalytic  high-temperature  of 850 °C.

GS and SLS \\nwere separated  and manually  transferred  to a new falcon \\ntube where distilled  water was added.  The centrifugation  \\nprocess  was repeated  2 to 4 times until GS and SLS were \\nseparated  in the falcon tubes. Then, GS and SLS were sep- \\narated by plastic  pipettes.  After separation,  samples  were \\ncleaned  with 1XPBS (7.2 mmol/L  Na 2 HPO 4 ·12H 2 O, 2.8 mmol/L  \\nNaH 2 PO 4 ·2H 2 O and 0.13 mmol/L  NaCl), and centrifuged  at \\n14000 r/min during  5 min (3 times).

Stratification  and long-term  performance  of the \\nUASB reactor  \\nThe UASB reactor  was operated  under a constant  sulfate  load- \\ning rate of 5.0 ±0.6 kg S/m 3 /day and an organic  loading  rate of 7.3 ±1.6 kg C/m 3 /day for 639 days. The gas production  rate \\nin the UASB and the sulfate,  TOC and glycerol  RE are pro- \\nvided in Fig. 1 to illustrate  the UASB performance.  Further,  \\nmore complete  details  of the experimental  performance  re- \\nsults of the UASB reactor  can be found elsewhere  ( Fernández-  \\nPalacios  et al., 2021 ). In brief, the operation  was divided  into \\nfour periods:  stage I, from day 0 to day 16, corresponding  to the \\nstart-up  and GS adaptation  period;  stage II, from day 16 to day \\n100, corresponding  to a period with a stable sulfate  reduction  \\nwith methane  production;  stage III, from day 100 to day 280, \\nunder stable sulfate  reduction  without  methane  production;  \\nand stage IV, from day 280 to day 639, when a decline  in the \\nsulfate  RE and glycerol  RE occurred.  After the adaptation  pe- \\nriod, stable sulfate  RE higher  than 83% were achieved  on stage \\nII and stage III and it decreased  to 38.8% on stage IV. In terms \\nof carbon,  over 97% of glycerol  RE was observed  on stage I, II \\nand III, but it decreased  to 64% on stage IV. It can be observed  \\nthat the TOC RE was positively  correlated  with the gas produc-  \\ntion. When the gas production  rate was higher  than 60 mL/hr,  \\nthe TOC RE was higher  than 86% on stage I and II. A progres-  \\nsive decrease  in the gas production  was accompanied  by the \\ndecrease  of TOC RE on stage II and III. The pH in the outlet of \\nthe UASB reactor  was maintained  at 7.0-7.3  (Appendix  A Fig. \\nS4). \\nDuring  stages II and III, a progressive  degranulation  of the \\nsludge  was observed  when methanogenic  activity  stopped.  \\nSludge  particle  size distribution  over the operation  period is \\nshown  in Appendix  A Fig. S5. The particle  size of the inocu- \\nlated sludge  below 200 μm accounted  for 74% of the inoculated  \\nsludge.  Compared  with inoculated  sludge,  the proportion  of 0- \\n200 μm sludge  in UASB1,  UASB2  and UASB3  decreased  on day \\n50 and day 149, accounting  for 49.6% ±4.5% in average.  How- \\never, the proportion  of particles  smaller  than 200 μm in UASB1,  \\nUASB2  and UASB3  increased  to 70.6% ±3.2% on day 230. Also, \\nthe proportion  of sludge  greater  than 1000 μm increased  from \\n2.1% in the inoculum  sludge  to over 7.3% in UASB1,  UASB2  \\nand UASB3  on days 50 and 149. However,  on day 230, the pro- \\nportion  of particles  larger than 1000 μm were reduced  to 1.6% \\n(in UASB2)  and 1.7% (in UASB3),  respectively.  Results  of D(0.5) \\nrevealed  that granular  size increased  from day 50 to day 149 \\nas the inoculum  sludge  D(0.5) was 105 μm, while the sludge  \\nD(0.5) in UASB1,  UASB2  and UASB3  were higher  than 150 μm \\non days 50 and 149 (Appendix  A Fig. S6).

Due to flotation,  part of the sludge  was re- \\ntained at UASB6,  where biomass  concentration  was 21.6 g/L \\non day 390 and dropped  to 8.7 g/L on day 639. The average  \\nbiomass  concentration  in the UASB reactor  gradually  dropped  \\nfrom 48.5 g/L to 14.9 g/L during  639 days operation.  The TSS \\nconcentration  in the UASB reactor  showed  the same trend as \\nVSS (data not shown).  The VSS/TSS  ratio ranged  from 74% to \\n87% during  the whole operation,  which shows that there was \\nalmost  no accumulation  of non-volatile  suspended  solids in \\nthe UASB reactor  indicating  that the main component  of SLS \\naccumulated  in the reactor  were volatile  solids. \\nFig. 2 b shows the washout  of biomass  from the reactor.  \\nThe biomass  loss fluctuated  in the range of 0.04 to 2.4 g/L be- \\nfore day 200.

The glycerol  consumption  rate and \\nsulfate  reduction  rate from UASB inlet to UASB1  were the high- \\nest, compared  with the rest of the sampling  points of the UASB \\nreactor.  On day 198, sulfate  reduction  and glycerol  degrada-  \\ntion were mainly  completed  at the bottom  part of the UASB \\nreactor  (UASB inlet to UASB2).

After the long- \\nterm operation  varying  COD/S-SO  4 2 −ratios, SLS was also ob- \\nserved.  Results  of FAMEs  analysis  of SLS samples  extracted  \\nfrom that operation  after 490 days are presented  in Appendix  \\nA Table S2. Palmitic  acid was the main LCFAs identified  and \\nquantified  compound  in SLS from samples  collected  at differ- \\nent heights  of the UASB reactor.  Other interesting  compounds  \\nthat were detected  in the samples  but were not quantified  \\nwere methyl  esters and wax esters.  \\n3. Discussion  \\nA progressive  decrease  in methane  production  was accom-  \\npanied  by the decrease  of TOC RE at a TOC/S-SO  4 2 −ra- \\ntio of 1.5 ±0.3 g C/g S when crude glycerol  was fed in \\nthe UASB reactor.  At the same time, VFAs (mainly  acetate,  \\npropionate)  progressively  accumulated  on stage III and IV \\n(Appendix  A Fig. S4). However,  the concentration  of the \\nnon-ionic  forms of VFAs (acetic  acid and propionic  mainly)  \\nwere residual  under the pH of operation  considering  the p K a of acetic and propionic  acids, 4.75 and 4.87, respec-  \\ntively. The microbial  diversity  dynamics  during  the long-term  \\noperation  of the UASB reactor  was studied  by Fernández-  \\nPalacios  et al. (2021) . The relative  abundance  of methanogens,  \\nincluding  Methanosaeta,  Methanobacteria,  Methanomicrobiales  , \\nshowed  a downward  trend. Methanogens  were hardly de- \\ntected after 230 days operation,  which confirmed  the wash- \\nout of methanogens.  In contrast,  a remarkable  increase  in the \\nrelative  abundance  of SRB was observed.  Illumina  sequencing  \\nresults  were consistent  with the results  of methane  produc-  \\ntion and VFAs accumulation,  proving  that methanogenic  GS \\nprogressively  switched  to sulfidogenic  sludge  performing  high \\nsulfate  RE. \\nThe pH and sulfide  concentration  play a major role in the \\ncompetition  between  SRB and methanogens  ( O’Flaherty  et al., \\n1998 ). The growth  rate of methanogens  was higher  than that \\nof SRB at pH < 7.0, and opposite  results  were found at pH > \\n7.5. The pH in the inlet of the UASB reactor  was over 7.5 dur- \\ning this study (Appendix  A Fig. S4). The toxicity  of sulfide  is \\ncaused  by undissociated  sulfide  molecules  that permeate  the \\ncell membrane  ( Kaksonen  and Puhakka,  2007 ). The inhibitory  \\neffect of H 2 S on methanogens  was greater  than that on SRB \\n( Sarti and Zaiat, 2011 ). Methane  production  by methanogenic  \\narchaea  can be limited  also by LCFAs,  specifically  palmitic  acid \\n( Deaver  et al., 2020 ; Silva et al., 2016 ). Palmitic  acid was iden- \\ntified as the main component  among  the LCFAs in the UASB \\nreactor  (Appendix  A Table S2). Palmitic  acid has a toxic effect \\non methanogenic  archaea  ( Silva et al., 2016 ), and the adsorp-  \\ntion of LCFAs onto microbial  biomass  can lead to mass transfer  \\nlimitation  of substrates  ( Pereira  et al., 2005 ), which might be a \\npotential  factor for the inhibition  of methanogenic  activity.  \\nThe overall  glycerol  RE of the UASB reactor  was over 90% \\nwith high sulfate  RE (over 83%) before day 280. However,  \\nboth the overall  glycerol  RE and sulfate  RE started  to de- \\ncline after 280 days of operation.  The decline  of granules  \\nsize was observed  after the cease of methanogenic  activ- \\nity. Wu et al. (2016) found that granule  size positively  corre- \\nlated with biogas production  rate. Acetotrophic  methanogens  \\nplayed  a key role in granulation  ( Hulshoff  Pol et al., 2004 ), \\nand the lack of methane  production  resulted  in poor sludge  \\ngranulation  ( Mora et al., 2020b ).

Weijma  et al. (2000) found the disintegration  \\nof sludge  in an expanded  GS bed reactor  treating  methanol  \\nduring  the period of low biogas production,  and reported  that \\nsludge  particles  were gradually  covered  by fluffy cotton-like  \\nmaterial.  Similarly,  in the present  study, when no biogas was \\nproduced  in the UASB reactor,  decrease  in granule  ´s size was \\nalso observed  followed  by SLS accumulation.  \\nAs it can be seen in SEM images,  the SLS presented  a \\nwhite cotton-like  aspect.  The formation  of SLS may be at- \\ntributed  to the accumulation  of intermediate  metabolites  in \\nextracellular  polymeric  substances,  such as fats, oils, greases,  \\nor polysaccharides  ( Jeganathan  et al., 2006 ; Lu et al., 2015b ). \\nThe formation  of SLS may also be due to the continuous  ac- \\ncumulation  of other organic  carbon  substances  in crude glyc- \\nerol that were not completely  degraded  by GS, thus encir- \\ncling the GS. It has been previously  reported  that crude glyc- \\nerol contains  FAMEs,  free fatty acids, glycerides  and LCFAs \\n( Hu et al., 2012 ; Viana et al., 2012 ). LCFAs can form a layer on \\nthe surface  of biomass  and prevent  the substrate  from enter- \\ning the biomass,  thus leading  to limited  substrate  diffusion  \\ninto the granules  ( Viana et al., 2012 ). In addition,  LCFAs can \\nattach the biomass  and cause its flotation  ( Viana et al., 2012 ). \\nHwu et al. (1998) found that treatment  of LCFAs-containing  \\nwastewater  in an UASB lead to methanogenesis  inhibition  and \\ngranular  sludge  flotation.  LCFAs accumulated  in the UASB re- \\nactor after long-term  operation  under sulfidogenic  conditions  \\nin our work. Sludge  flotation  is a limiting  factor for anaero-  \\nbic treatment  of wastewater  with higher  loading  rates because  \\nthis phenomenon  can lead to a severe biomass  washout  and \\nsystem  performance  deterioration  ( Jeganathan  et al., 2006 ). As \\ncan be observed  in Fig. 2 d, the decrease  in biomass  concentra-  \\ntion is accompanied  by a decrease  in sulfate  RE and sulfate  \\nremoval  capacity,  which indicated  that sludge  flotation  lead \\nto the washout  of biomass  and the drop of the reactor  perfor-  \\nmance.  This may explain  the gradual  decline  of sulfate  RE and \\nglycerol  RE at stage IV of the long-term  UASB operation.  \\nThe evaluation  of UASB reactor  stratification  can help to \\nunderstand  the effect of the sludge  at different  heights  on sul- \\nfate reduction  and degradation  of organic  compounds.  It is ob- \\nserved  that sulfate  reduction  and glycerol  degradation  were \\nmainly  completed  at the bottom  of the UASB reactor,  which \\nwas due to the high biomass  concentration  at this height of \\nthe UASB reactor  (UASB inlet to UASB2).  The biomass  at the \\nbottom  of the sludge  bed (UASB inlet to UASB2)  accounted  \\nfor over 70% of the overall  VSS of the reactor  before 300 days \\nof UASB operation.  The biomass  from UASB inlet to UASB2  \\nalso accounted  for 57% and 78% on day 390 and day 639, re- \\nspectively.  Results  are consistent  with previous  studies,  which \\nfound that the higher  methanogenic  activity  was observed  at \\nthe bottom  of the sludge  bed in an UASB-anaerobic  membrane  \\nbioreactor  treating  municipal  wastewater  because  the con- \\ncentration  of VSS increased  along with the decreasing  height \\nof the sludge  bed ( Mahmoud  et al., 2004 ; Ozgun  et al., 2019 ). \\nSimilarly  to what was observed  by Ozgun  et al. (2019) , the high- \\nest specific  methanogenic  activity  was observed  at the bottom  \\npart of the sludge  bed, as the more active biomass  remained  \\nnear the inlet of the reactor,  while the inactive  biomass  moved  \\ntowards  the top of the sludge  bed or suspended  on the top of \\nthe reactor.  GS, SCGS and SLS were also investigated  by batch activ- \\nity tests to identify  the influence  of SLS on the mechanism  \\nof sulfate  reduction  and glycerol  degradation.  When propi- \\nonate was used as carbon  source  to reduce  sulfate,  SRB con- \\nverted propionate  to acetate  and inorganic  carbon.  The mech- \\nanism of sulfate  reduction  with propionate  observed  herein  \\nis consistent  with previous  studies  ( Liamleam  and Annach-  \\nhatre, 2007 ; Muyzer  and Stams,  2008 ). Since the same prod- \\nucts were observed  in the activity  test performed  with GS and \\nSCGS using propionate  to reduce  sulfate  as shown  in Fig. 5 , \\nit can be concluded  that the SLS presented  the same mecha-  \\nnism of sulfate  reduction.  However,  the specific  sulfate  reduc-  \\ntion rate was higher  in the case of GS than in that of SCGS, \\nindicating  that SLS may affect the mass transfer  of the sub- \\nstrates,  resulting  in a decrease  of the specific  sulfate  reduction  \\nrate. \\nIn the activity  tests performed  with GS and SLS with glyc- \\nerol as the carbon  source  to reduce  sulfate,  both GS and SLS \\nfermented  glycerol  into formate,  acetate,  propionate,  ethanol,  \\n1,3-propanediol  and inorganic  carbon.  In addition,  the inter- \\nmediate  products  of glycerol  were consumed  with sulfate  re- \\nduction  observed.  This indicates  that SLS is also capable  of fer- \\nmenting  glycerol  and reducing  sulfate.  When comparing  the \\nspecific  rates of glycerol  fermentation  between  GS and SLS, \\nSLS was more efficient  in degrading  glycerol  than GS. The spe- \\ncific substrate  utilization  activity  of GS and flocculant  sludge  \\nwas compared  in UASB reactors  processing  wastewater  from \\nfood industries  ( Oleszkiewicz  and Romanek,  1989 ). They found \\nthat the flocculant  sludge  formed  during  the operation  of an \\nUASB reactor  had a higher  specific  activity  for the degrada-  \\ntion of complex  polymers  than the GS in anaerobic  processes,  \\nwhich is similar  to the results  found herein.  \\nFig. 6 a and b show that sulfate  reduction  was not related  \\nto glycerol  fermentation.  Sulfate  was reduced  accompanied  \\nby the degradation  intermediate  products  of glycerol  degra- \\ndation.  This confirmed  that the carbon  sources  used for sul- \\nfate reduction  were formate,  ethanol  and 1,3-propanediol,  \\nin which the mechanism  of sulfate  reduction  using glycerol  \\nas the carbon  source  is consistent  with our previous  work \\n( Zhou et al., 2022 ). When comparing  the specific  rates of sul- \\nfate reduction  between  GS and SLS, SLS was found to be less \\nefficient  in reducing  sulfate  than GS. In addition,  as can be \\nseen in Fig. 6 d, even if there was sufficient  carbon  source  (for- \\nmate, ethanol  and 1,3-propanediol)  to reduce  sulfate,  SLS still \\nneeded  time to adapt and perform  the sulfate  reduction  pro- \\ncess, which may be caused  by mass transfer  limitation  of sul- \\nfate. Compared  with GS in the UASB reactor,  GS covered  by \\nSLS may cause sulfate  to be discharged  from the UASB reac- \\ntor before entering  the cell due to mass transfer  limitation,  \\nwhich may lead to a decrease  in the sulfate  reduction  effi- \\nciency.  Therefore,  a significant  reason  for the reduced  sulfate  \\nRE in the UASB reactor  may also be that the SLS limited  the \\nmass transfer  of sulfate,  in addition  to biomass  washout  from \\nthe UASB reactor.  \\nThe difference  of specific  rates between  GS and SLS were \\nalso caused  by the bacteria  community  differences.  A wide \\nrange of microorganisms  have been observed  to ferment  glyc- \\nerol, including  Dysgonomonas  ( Moscoviz  et al., 2018 ), Klebsiella  \\n( Cheng et al., 2007 ), Propionibacterium  ( Himmi  et al., 2000 ) and \\nPropionispora  ( Abou-Zeid  et al., 2004 ) .

Anaerobic  Propionis-  \\npora genus typically  degrades  organic  carbon  compounds  in \\nacidogenesis  rather than acetogenesis.  Enterobacter  and Kleb- \\nsiella , facultative  anaerobes,  are able to produce  hydrogen  \\nand acetate  through  the fermentation  of organic  substrates  \\n( Hung et al., 2011 ; Joubert  and Britz, 1987 ). Helicobacter  is con- \\nsidered  to be a microaerophile  capable  of oxidizing  a variety  of \\norganic  acids, such as formate,  lactate,  succinate  and pyruvate  \\n( Joubert  and Britz, 1987 ). In this work, the relative  abundances  \\nof fermentative  microorganisms  in GS (33.0%)  were lower than \\nthat in SLS (54.6%),  which agrees with the lower glycerol  fer- \\nmentation  rate in GS and higher  fermentation  rate in SLS. \\nDesulfovibrio  is a genus of SRB reported  to oxidize  organic  \\ncarbon  compounds  (including  lactate,  ethanol,  malate,  pyru- \\nvate, succinate)  to acetate  for sulfate  reduction  ( Odom and \\nPeck, 1981 ; Qatibi et al., 1991 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). Desulfobulbus  \\ngenus can oxidize  pyruvate,  propionate  and ethanol  to ac- \\netate ( Bak and Pfennig,  1991 ; Bertolino  et al., 2012 ; Muyzer  and \\nStams,  2008 ; Zeng et al., 2019 ). The main sulfate-reducer  gen- \\nera found herein  were Desulfobulbus  and Desulfovibrio  , both re- \\nported  as incomplete  oxidizing  SRB, which explains  the ac- \\ncumulation  of acetate  in the batch activity  tests. Compared  \\nto SLS, higher  relative  abundances  of Desulfobulbus  and Desul- \\nfovibrio  in GS agree with the higher  sulfate  reduction  rate \\nfound in GS, meaning  that the populations  of SRB were prob- \\nably mainly  growing  in the core of the granules,  what can also \\nexplain  the decrease  of sulfate  RE when granules  turned  into \\nslime-covered  granules.  \\nBatch activity  tests and 16s rRNA gene analysis  of the mi- \\ncrobial  communities  revealed  that GS played  a more impor-  \\ntant role in sulfate  reduction  than SLS since GS contained  \\nmore sulfate  reducers  (mainly  Desulfobulbus  and Desulfovibrio  ). \\nIn terms of fermentation,  glycerol  fermentation  was not af- \\nfected by SLS. Conversely,  the fermentation  rate of glycerol  \\nin SLS was higher  than that of GS. The analysis  of microbial  \\ndiversity  revealed  that high relative  abundances  of fermen-  \\ntative microorganisms  was identified  in SLS. This shows that \\nthe reason  for the decrease  of the glycerol  RE in UASB reactor  \\nwas not related  to the degradation  mechanism  of glycerol  by \\nthe SLS, but because  the SLS triggered  the washout  of biomass  \\nfrom the UASB reactor.  \\nFTIR spectra  showed  no significant  differences  between  GS \\nand SLS samples.  The biggest  difference  of peaks between  \\nGS and SLS was around  at 1635 and 1030 cm −1 . The ratio \\nbetween  the absorbance  at 1635 cm −1 over the absorbance  \\nat 1030 cm −1 shows the relatively  quantity  of protein.  The \\nratio was 1.1 for SLS and 0.8 for GS, which indicates  that \\nSLS contained  relatively  more proteins  than GS. Proteins  are \\nfundamental  components  of biomolecules.  The soluble  pro- \\ntein content  generally  increases  after exposure  to pollutants.  \\nIn order to reduce  toxic effects,  microbes  can be induced  \\nto synthesize  defensive  proteins  under the stress of haz- \\nardous  substances  ( Imlay, 2008 ; Sabatini  et al., 2009 ). Specif-  \\nically, Li et al. (2022) showed  that excessive  extracellular  poly- \\nmeric substances  (EPS) production,  especially  the protein-  \\nlike substances,  was an effective  strategy  for reducing  certain  \\nnanoparticles  toxicity  in anaerobic  granular  sludge.  Since SLS covered  GS, SLS first contacted  LCFAs and sulfide  during  glyc- \\nerol fermentation  and sulfate  reduction.  Thus, compared  to \\nGS, SLS had higher  exposure  to sulfide  and LCFAs,  which may \\nexplain  higher  protein  contents  in SLS. \\nOverall,  different  methods  (SEM, FAMEs,  Illumina  sequenc-  \\ning and FT-IR) used for SLS analysis  showed  that SLS was the \\nmixture  of biomass  and organic/inorganic  compounds  com- \\ning from the impurities  contained  in crude glycerol  and the \\nformation  of other intermediate  products.  With all the in- \\nformation  acquired,  the formation  of SLS was attributed  to \\na combination  of factors  along the long-term  operation,  in- \\ncluding  sulfide  production,  the cease of methanogenic  activity,  \\nwashout  of methanogens,  static sludge  bed, impurities  com- \\npounds  contained  in crude glycerol  and the formation  of other \\nintermediates.  \\nAs a by-product  of the biodiesel  industry,  there are clear ad- \\nvantages  in the use of crude glycerol  as electron  donor such as \\nits large COD content,  its availability  and low cost among  oth- \\ners. However,  the presence  of impurities  may hinder  its appli- \\ncation unless  alternatives  to face long-term  operation  issues \\nare found.  Oleszkiewicz  and Romanek  (1989) reported  that the \\naddition  of calcium  and phosphate  promoted  sticky, floccu-  \\nlant sludge  formation,  while granular  biomass  was formed  in \\nthe treatment  of wastewater  supplemented  with ferric ions \\nand traces of nickel and cobalt.  The use of traces of metallic  \\nelements  can promote  granulation  and avoid sludge  disinte-  \\ngration  and washout  of biomass.  Increasing  the shear force in \\nthe reactor  could be another  strategy  for preventing  granules  \\nflotation  ( Chen et al., 2014 ) and crude glycerol  by-products  ac- \\ncumulation.  The increase  of shearing  forces can be achieved  \\nby adding  an internal  recirculation  pump to increase  the up- \\nflow velocity  as well as the use of intermittent  pulses of nitro- \\ngen from the bottom  of the reactor  to also avoid bed packing.  \\nHowever,  further  research  is needed  in order to assess the vi- \\nability of such alternatives.  Despite  the fact that the perfor-  \\nmance  deterioration  was mainly  attributed  to the washout  \\nof biomass  due to SLS accumulation  and consequent  sludge  \\nflotation,  still other factors  not considered  in the present  work \\nsuch as the change  of the metabolic  functions  of the micro-  \\nbial cultures  linked to the SLS accumulation  should  be inves- \\ntigated.  \\n4. Conclusions  \\nThe lack of biogas production  in a sulfate-reducing  UASB lead \\nto a reduction  in the particle  size of granular  biomass  and to \\nthe accumulation  of a SLS due to the presence  of organic  com- \\npounds  and other impurities  present  in crude glycerol.  SLS ac- \\ncumulation  also led to sludge  flotation,  which resulted  in an \\nincreased  washout  of sludge.  Subsequently,  the sulfate  RE and \\nglycerol  RE in the reactor  decreased,  and the system  perfor-  \\nmance  deteriorated.  Sulfate  removal  capacity  and glycerol  re- \\nmoval capacity  at different  heights  of the UASB reactor  corre- \\nlated well with the sludge  concentration.  In the sulfate  reduc-  \\ntion processes  with propionate  and glycerol  as carbon  sources  \\nin batch tests, results  confirmed  that SLS did not change  the \\nmechanism  of sulfate  reduction  and glycerol  degradation  but \\ndecreased  the rate of sulfate  reduction.
